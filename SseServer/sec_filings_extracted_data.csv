See \x93Where You Can Find More Information\x94 and \x93Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-\nLooking Statements\x94 in this prospectus. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only\nrisks facing us and your investment in the Registered Notes. Additional risks and uncertainties that we\nare unaware of, or those we currently deem less significant, also may become important factors that\naffect us. The following risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition,\nresults of operations or liquidity. The value of the Registered Notes could decline due to any of these\nrisks, and you may lose all or part of your investment. Risks Related to the Registered Notes The\nIndenture governing the Registered Notes does not contain financial covenants or meaningful restrictions\non us or our subsidiaries. Neither Microsoft nor any of its subsidiaries are restricted from incurring\nadditional debt or other liabilities, including debt secured by liens, under the Indenture. Microsoft may\nfrom time to time incur additional debt and other liabilities. In addition, Microsoft is not restricted\nfrom paying dividends or making distributions on Microsoft\x92s capital stock or purchasing or redeeming\ncapital stock under the Indenture. Active trading markets for the Registered Notes may not develop. The\nRegistered Notes are new issues of securities with no established trading. Microsoft does not intend to\napply for listing of the Registered Notes on any securities exchange. We cannot assure you trading\nmarkets for the Registered Notes will develop or of the ability of holders of the Registered Notes to\nsell their notes or of the prices at which holders may be able to sell their notes. The dealer managers\nare not obligated to make a market in any series of Registered Notes, and any market-making with respect\nto the Registered Notes may be discontinued, in their sole discretion, at any time without notice. If no\nactive trading markets develop, you may be unable to resell the Registered Notes at any price or at their\nfair market value. If trading markets do develop, changes in Microsoft\x92s ratings or the financial markets\ncould adversely affect the market prices of the Registered Notes. The market prices of the Registered\nNotes will depend on many factors, including, among others, the following:\n                                                                   \n      ratings on our debt securities assigned by rating agencies;  \n                                                                   \n                                                                                  \n      the prevailing interest rates being paid by other companies similar to us;  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                         \n      our results of operations, financial condition and prospects; and  \n                                                                         \n                                               \n      the condition of the financial markets.  \n                                               \nThe condition of the financial markets and prevailing interest rates have fluctuated in the past and are\nlikely to fluctuate in the future, which could have an adverse effect on the market prices of the\nRegistered Notes. Rating agencies continually review the ratings they have assigned to companies and debt\nsecurities. Negative changes in the ratings assigned to us or our debt securities could have an adverse\neffect on the market prices of the Registered Notes. 9\n\nRisks Related to the Exchange Offers\n\nYou may have difficulty selling the Restricted Notes that you do not exchange.\n\nIf you do not exchange your Restricted Notes for Registered Notes in the exchange offers, you will\ncontinue to be subject to the restrictions\non transfer of your Restricted Notes described in the legend on your Restricted Notes and we will not be\nrequired to offer another opportunity for you to exchange your Restricted Notes for registered notes,\nexcept in limited circumstances. The\nrestrictions on transfer of your Restricted Notes arise because we issued the Restricted Notes under\nexemptions from, or in transactions not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act\nand applicable state securities laws. In\ngeneral, you may offer or sell the Restricted Notes only if they are registered under the Securities Act\nand applicable state securities laws or are offered and sold under an exemption from these requirements.\nWe do not intend to register the\nRestricted Notes that remain outstanding after completion of the exchange offers under the Securities\nAct. We may in the future seek to acquire untendered Restricted Notes in the open market or privately\nnegotiated transactions, through subsequent\nexchange offers or otherwise. We have no present plans to acquire any Restricted Notes that are not\ntendered in the exchange offers or to file a registration statement to permit resales of any untendered\nRestricted Notes. To the extent Restricted\nNotes are tendered and accepted in the exchange offers, the trading market, if any, for the remaining\nRestricted Notes would likely be adversely affected. See \x93Terms of the Exchange Offers\x97Consequences of\nFailure to Exchange\x94 for a discussion of the possible consequences of failing to exchange your Restricted\nNotes.\n\nBecause we\nanticipate that most holders of the Restricted Notes will elect to exchange their Restricted Notes, we\nexpect that the liquidity of the market for any Restricted Notes remaining after the completion of the\nexchange offers will be substantially\nlimited. Any Restricted Notes tendered and exchanged in the exchange offers will reduce the aggregate\nprincipal amount of the Restricted Notes of the applicable series outstanding. Following the exchange\noffers, if you do not tender your Restricted\nNotes you generally will not have any further registration rights, and your Restricted Notes will\ncontinue to be subject to certain transfer restrictions. Accordingly, the liquidity of the market for the\nRestricted Notes could be adversely affected.\n\nBroker-dealers or noteholders may become subject to the registration and prospectus delivery requirements\nof the Securities Act.\n\nAny broker-dealer that exchanges its Restricted Notes in the exchange offers for the purpose of\nparticipating in a distribution of the\nRegistered Notes, or resells Registered Notes that were received by it for its own account in the\nexchange offers, may be deemed to have received restricted securities and may be required to comply with\nthe registration and prospectus delivery\nrequirements of the Securities Act in connection with any resale transaction by that broker-dealer. Any\nprofit on the resale of the Registered Notes and any commission or concessions received by a broker-\ndealer may be deemed to be underwriting\ncompensation under the Securities Act.\n\nIn addition to broker-dealers, any noteholder that exchanges its Restricted Notes in the exchange\noffers for the purpose of participating in a distribution of the Registered Notes may be deemed to have\nreceived restricted securities and may be required to comply with the registration and prospectus\ndelivery requirements of the Securities Act in\nconnection with any resale transaction by that noteholder.\n\nYou must comply with the exchange offer procedures in order to receive freely tradable Registered Notes.\n\nDelivery of the Registered Notes in exchange for the Restricted Notes tendered and accepted for exchange\npursuant\nto the exchange offers will be made only if such tenders comply with the exchange offer procedures\ndescribed herein, including the timely receipt by the exchange agent of book-entry transfer of the\nRestricted Notes into such exchange agent\x92s\naccount at DTC, as depositary, including an agent\x92s message. We are not required to notify you of defects\nor irregularities in tenders of Restricted Notes for exchange. The method of delivery of Restricted Notes\nand all other required documents\nto the exchange agent is at the election and risk of the holders of the Restricted Notes.\n\n10\n\nConsummation of the exchange offers may not occur.\n\nEach of the exchange offers is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. See \x93Terms of the\nExchange Offers\x97Conditions to the Exchange Offers.\x94 Even if the exchange offers are completed, they may\nnot be completed on the timing described in this prospectus. Accordingly, holders participating in the\nexchange offers may have to\nwait longer than expected to receive their Registered Notes, during which time such holders will not be\nable to effect transfers of their Restricted Notes tendered in the exchange offers. Until we announce\nwhether we have accepted valid tenders of\nRestricted Notes for exchange pursuant to an exchange offer, no assurance can be given that such exchange\noffer will be completed. In addition, subject to applicable law and as provided in this prospectus, we\nmay, in our sole discretion, extend, re-open, amend, waive any condition of or terminate any of the\nexchange offers at any time before our announcement of whether we will accept valid tenders of Restricted\nNotes for exchange pursuant to such exchange\noffer, which we expect to make as soon as reasonably practicable after the expiration date.\n\n11\n\nUSE OF PROCEEDS\n\nWe will not receive any cash proceeds from the issuance of the Registered Notes. In consideration for\nissuing the Registered Notes as\ncontemplated in this prospectus, the Company will receive in exchange Restricted Notes in like principal\namount, which will be cancelled, and, as such, issuing the Registered Notes will not result in any\nincrease in the Company\x92s indebtedness.\n\n12\n\nTERMS OF THE EXCHANGE OFFERS\n\nPurpose and Effect of the Exchange Offers\n\nWe and the dealer managers entered into a Registration Rights Agreement with respect to the Restricted\nNotes on November 6, 2023. Pursuant\nto the Registration Rights Agreement, we agreed, among other things, to use commercially reasonable\nefforts to (1) file a registration statement on Form S-4 with respect to a registered offer to exchange\neach series of Restricted Notes for a like aggregate principal amount of Registered Notes, with terms\nsubstantially identical in all material respects to such series of Restricted Notes (except that the\nRegistered Notes will not contain terms with\nrespect to transfer restrictions or any increase in annual interest rate) and (2) cause the registration\nstatement to be declared effective under the Securities Act by January 29, 2025. In furtherance of the\nforegoing, we have filed with\nthe SEC a registration statement on Form S-4 (File No. 333- ) with respect to the exchange offers and the\nRegistered Notes. We agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to\ncomplete the exchange offer for each series of notes within 60 days after the registration statement is\ndeclared effective by the SEC. If for any reason the exchange offers are not completed on or prior to\nJanuary 29, 2025 or if, following such\ndate, the Company receives a written request from certain holders of the Restricted Notes for the filing\nof a shelf registration statement, then the Company will be required to use commercially reasonable\nefforts to file and cause to become\neffective a shelf registration statement under the Securities Act which would cover resales of the\nregistrable securities of such series held by such persons.\n\nAfter the SEC declares this exchange offer registration statement effective, we will offer the Registered\nNotes in return for the Restricted\nNotes. Each of the exchange offers will remain open for no fewer than 20 business days (or longer if\nrequired by applicable law) beginning with the date we electronically deliver notice of such exchange\noffer to the holders of the applicable\nRestricted Notes. For each Restricted Note surrendered to us pursuant to an exchange offer, the holder of\nthe Restricted Note will receive a Registered Note having a principal amount equal to that of the\nsurrendered Restricted Note. Interest on the\nRegistered Notes will be payable semi-annually and will accrue from the most recent interest payment date\non which interest was paid on the applicable series of Restricted Notes prior to the date such series of\nRegistered Notes are issued, which was\nDecember 15, 2023 in the case of the Registered 2027 Notes and the Registered 2047 Notes and March 15,\n2024 in the case of the Registered 2026 Notes, the Registered 2030 Notes and the Registered 2050 Notes.\n\nUnder existing SEC interpretations, the Registered Notes acquired in the exchange offers by holders of\nRestricted Notes will be freely\ntransferable without further registration under the Securities Act if the holder of the Registered Notes\nis acquiring the Registered Notes in the ordinary course of its business, has no arrangement or\nunderstanding to participate in the distribution\nof the Registered Notes and is not an affiliate of the Company, as such terms are interpreted by the SEC;\nhowever, broker-dealers (\x93participating broker-dealers\x94) receiving Registered Notes in a registered\nexchange offer will also\nhave a prospectus delivery requirement with respect to resales of such Registered Notes. The SEC has\ntaken the position that participating broker-dealers may fulfill their prospectus delivery requirements\nwith respect to Registered Notes (other than\na resale of an unsold allotment from the original sale of the Restricted Notes) with the prospectus\ncontained in the exchange offer registration statement relating to such Registered Notes.\n\nThis prospectus, as it may be amended or supplemented from time to time, may be used by a broker-dealer\nin connection with resales of\nRegistered Notes received in exchange for Restricted Notes that were acquired by such broker-dealer as a\nresult of market-making or other trading activities. We have agreed that, for a period of up to 180 days\nafter the expiration date of the\nexchange offers, if requested by one or more such broker-dealers, we will amend or supplement this\nprospectus in order to expedite or facilitate the disposition of any Registered Notes by any such broker-\ndealers.\n\nA holder of Restricted Notes who exchanges its Restricted Notes for Registered Notes in the exchange\noffers will be deemed to represent that\n(1) any Registered Notes to be received by it will be acquired in the ordinary course of its business,\n(2) at the time of the commencement of the exchange offers, it has no\n\n13\n\narrangement or understanding with any person to participate in the distribution (within the meaning of\nthe Securities Act) of the Registered Notes in violation of the provisions of the Securities\nAct and it is not engaged in, and does not intend to engage in, the distribution of the Registered Notes,\n(3) it is not an \x93affiliate\x94 (within the meaning of Rule 405 under the Securities Act) of the Company,\nand (4) if such\nholder is a broker-dealer that will receive the Registered Notes for its own account in exchange for the\nRestricted Notes that were acquired as a result of market-making or other trading activities, then such\nholder will deliver a prospectus (or, to\nthe extent permitted by law, make available a prospectus to purchasers) in connection with any resale of\nsuch Registered Notes. See \x93Plan of Distribution.\x94\n\nThe Registration Rights Agreement provides, among other things, that if we have not exchanged Registered\nNotes for all Restricted Notes\nvalidly tendered in accordance with the terms of the exchange offers on or prior to January 29, 2025, or\nif a shelf registration statement is required under the limited circumstances set forth in the\nRegistration Rights Agreement and such shelf\nregistration statement is not declared effective on or prior to the 60th day after the later of January\n29, 2025 and the date on which the Company receives a duly executed request from certain holders of\nRestricted Notes for the filing of a\nshelf registration, then the annual interest rate on the Restricted Notes will increase initially by\n0.25% per annum for the first 90-day period immediately following the occurrence of such registration\ndefault. The annual interest rate on the Restricted Notes will increase by an additional 0.25% per annum\nfor each subsequent 90-day period that such additional interest continues to accrue; however, the rate\nat which such additional interest accrues may in no event exceed 1.00% per annum. The additional interest\nwill cease to accrue when all registration defaults are cured. See \x93Exchange Offers; Registration\nRights.\x94\n\nResale of Registered Notes\n\nBased on the\nposition that the staff of the SEC enunciated in Exxon Capital Holdings Corporation, Morgan Stanley& Co.\nIncorporated and Shearman& Sterling, the Registered Notes issued in the\nexchange offers may be offered for resale, resold and otherwise transferred without registration under\nthe Securities Act, and without delivering a prospectus that satisfies the requirements of Section 10 of\nthe Securities Act, if the holder of\nthe Restricted Notes who wishes to exchange its Restricted Notes for Registered Notes can make the\nrepresentations set forth below under \x93\x97Procedures for Tendering the Restricted Notes.\x94 However, if such\nholder intends to\nparticipate in a distribution of the Registered Notes, is a broker-dealer that acquired the Restricted\nNotes directly from us for its own account in the initial offering of the Restricted Notes and not as a\nresult of market-making activities or\nother trading activities or is an \x93affiliate\x94 of the Company as defined in Rule 405 under the Securities\nAct, such holder will not be eligible to participate in the exchange offers, and must comply with the\nregistration and prospectus\ndelivery requirements of the Securities Act in connection with the resale of its Restricted Notes. See\n\x93\x97Additional Obligations\x94 below.\n\nA broker-dealer that has acquired Restricted Notes as a result of market-making or other trading\nactivities has to deliver a prospectus in\norder to resell any Registered Notes it receives for its own account in the exchange offers. This\nprospectus, as it may be amended or supplemented from time to time, may be used by a broker-dealer in\nconnection with resales of Registered Notes\nreceived in exchange for Restricted Notes that were acquired by such broker-dealer as a result of market-\nmaking or other trading activities. We have agreed that, for a period of up to 180 days after the\nexpiration date of the exchange offers, if\nrequested by one or more such broker-dealers, we will amend or supplement this prospectus in order to\nexpedite or facilitate the disposition of any Registered Notes by any such broker-dealers. See \x93Plan of\nDistribution\x94 for more\ninformation regarding broker-dealers.\n\nThe exchange offers are not being made to, nor will we accept tenders for exchange from, holders of\nRestricted Notes in any jurisdiction in which these exchange offers or the acceptance of the exchange\noffers would not be in compliance with the securities or blue sky laws.\n\n14\n\nTerms of the Exchange Offers\n\nUpon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this prospectus, we will accept for exchange\nany and all Restricted Notes properly\ntendered and not withdrawn prior to the expiration time. The Restricted Notes may only be tendered in\ndenominations of $2,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess of $2,000. We will issue $2,000\nprincipal amount or an integral multiple of\n$1,000 in excess thereof of Registered Notes in exchange for a corresponding principal amount of\nRestricted Notes surrendered in the exchange offers. In exchange for each Restricted Note surrendered in\nthe exchange offers, we will issue a Registered\nNote with a like principal amount.\n\nThe form and terms of the Registered Notes will be substantially identical in all material respects to\nthe form and terms of the Restricted Notes, except that the Registered Notes will not be subject to\nrestrictions on transfer or to any increase in annual interest rate for failure to comply with the\nRegistration Rights Agreement.\n\nThe Registered Notes will evidence the same debt as the Restricted Notes. The Registered Notes will be\nissued under and entitled to the\nbenefits of the same Indenture that authorized the issuance of the Restricted Notes. Consequently, each\nseries of Registered Notes and the corresponding Restricted Notes that are not exchanged in the\napplicable exchange offer will be treated as a\nsingle series of debt securities under the Indenture for all purposes of the Indenture, along with any\nadditional notes of any applicable series issued pursuant to the Indenture.\n\nThe exchange offers are not conditioned upon any minimum aggregate principal amount of Registered Notes\nbeing tendered for exchange. None of\nthe exchange offers is conditioned on the consummation of any of the other exchange offers.\n\nThere will be no fixed record date for\ndetermining registered holders of Restricted Notes entitled to participate in the exchange offers.\n\nWe intend to conduct the exchange\noffers in accordance with the provisions of the Registration Rights Agreement, the applicable\nrequirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, and the rules and regulations of the SEC.\nRestricted Notes that are not tendered for exchange in\nthe exchange offers will remain outstanding and continue to accrue interest and will be entitled to the\nrights and benefits such holders have under the Indenture.\n\nWe will be deemed to have accepted for exchange properly tendered Restricted Notes when we have given\nwritten notice of the acceptance to the\nexchange agent. The exchange agent will act as agent for the tendering holders for the purposes of\nreceiving the Registered Notes from the Company and delivering the Registered Notes to such holders.\nSubject to the terms of the exchange offers and\nthe Registration Rights Agreement, we expressly reserve the right to amend or terminate any of the\nexchange offers, and to not accept for exchange any Restricted Notes not previously accepted for\nexchange. Holders of the Restricted Notes do not have\nany appraisal or dissenters\x92 rights in connection with the exchange offers\n\nWe will pay all charges and expenses, other than those\nbrokerage commissions or fees or transfer or other taxes described below, in connection with the exchange\noffers. It is important that you read the section titled \x93\x97Fees and Expenses\x94 below for more details\nregarding fees and\nexpenses incurred in the exchange offers.\n\nExpiration Time; Extensions; Amendments\n\nEach of the exchange offers will expire at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on , 2024, unless, in our sole\ndiscretion, we extend the expiration time of such exchange offer.\n\nIn order to extend the exchange offers, we will notify the exchange\nagent in writing of any extension of such exchange offer. We will notify registered holders of the\napplicable Restricted Notes in writing or by public announcement of the extension, if any, of the\nexpiration time by no later than 9:00 a.m., New York\nCity time, on the business day after the previously scheduled expiration time.\n\n15\n\nWe expressly reserve the right, in our sole discretion:\n                                                                                                        \n      to delay accepting for exchange any Restricted Notes due to an extension of the exchange offers;  \n                                                                                                        \n                                                                                                         \n      to extend the exchange offers or to terminate the exchange offers and to refuse to accept          \n      Restricted Notes not                                                                               \n      previously accepted if any of the conditions set forth under \x93\x97Conditions to the Exchange Offers\x94     \n      have not been satisfied by giving written notice of such extension or termination to the exchange  \n      agent; or                                                                                          \n                                                                                                         \n                                                                                                         \n      subject to the terms of the Registration Rights Agreement, to amend the terms of the exchange      \n      offers in any                                                                                      \n      manner.                                                                                            \n                                                                                                         \nAny such delay in acceptance, extension or termination will be followed as promptly as practicable by\nwritten notice or public announcement thereof to the registered holders of Restricted Notes. If we amend\nany of the exchange offers in a manner that we determine to constitute a material change, we will\npromptly disclose such amendment in a manner reasonably calculated to inform the holders of the relevant\nRestricted Notes of such amendment. Without limiting the manner in which we may choose to make public\nannouncements of any delay in acceptance, extension, termination or amendment of any of the exchange\noffers, we shall have no obligation to publish, advertise or otherwise communicate any such public\nannouncement other than by issuing a timely press release to a financial news service. If we make any\nmaterial change to any of the exchange offers, we will disclose this change by means of a post-effective\namendment to the registration statement that includes this prospectus and will distribute an amended or\nsupplemented prospectus to each registered holder of relevant Restricted Notes. In addition, we will\nextend the relevant exchange offer(s) for an additional five to ten business days as required by the\nExchange Act, depending on the significance of the amendment, if the exchange offer(s) would otherwise\nexpire during that period. We will promptly notify the exchange agent by written notice of any delay in\nacceptance, extension, termination or amendment of any of the exchange offers. Conditions to the Exchange\nOffers Notwithstanding any other terms of the exchange offers, we will not be required to accept for\nexchange, or exchange any Registered Notes for, any Restricted Notes, and we may terminate any of the\nexchange offers as provided in this prospectus before accepting any Restricted Notes for exchange, if:\n                                                                                                         \n      the exchange offers would violate any applicable law, rule, regulation or applicable               \n      interpretations of the staff                                                                       \n      of the SEC; or                                                                                     \n                                                                                                         \n                                                                                                         \n      any action or proceeding has been instituted or threatened in any court or by or before any        \n      governmental agency                                                                                \n      with respect to the exchange offers which, in our judgment, could reasonably be expected to        \n      impair our ability to proceed with the exchange offers.                                            \n                                                                                                         \nIn addition, we will not be obligated to accept for exchange the Restricted Notes of any holder that has\nnot been deemed to have made the representations described under \x93 \x97Purpose and Effect of the Exchange\nOffers,\x94 \x93 \x97 Procedures for Tendering the Restricted Notes\x94 and \x93 Plan of Distribution,\x94 and such other\nrepresentations as may be reasonably necessary under applicable SEC rules, regulations or interpretations\nto make available to it an appropriate form for registration of the Registered Notes under the Securities\nAct. We expressly reserve the right, at any time or at various times, to extend the period of time during\nwhich any of the exchange offers are open. Consequently, we may delay acceptance of any Restricted Notes\nby giving written notice (including by public announcement) of such extension to the registered holders\nof the relevant Restricted Notes as promptly as practicable. During any such extensions, all relevant\nRestricted Notes previously tendered will remain subject to the applicable exchange offers, and we may\naccept them for exchange unless they have been previously withdrawn. We will return any Restricted Notes\nthat we do not accept for exchange for any reason without expense to the tendering holder promptly after\nthe expiration or termination of the exchange offers. 16\n\nWe expressly reserve the right to amend or terminate any of the exchange offers, and to reject for\nexchange any Restricted Notes not previously accepted for exchange, upon the occurrence of any of the\nconditions of the exchange offers specified above. We will give written notice or public announcement of\nany extension, amendment, non-acceptanceor termination to the registered holders of the relevant\nRestricted Notes as promptly as practicable. In the case of any extension, such notice will be issued no\nlater than 9:00 a.m., New York City time, on the business day after the previously scheduled expiration\ntime. These conditions are for our sole benefit, and we may assert them regardless of the circumstances\nthat may give rise to them or waive them in whole or in part at any or at various times in our sole\ndiscretion; providedthat any waiver of a condition of tender with respect to any of the exchange offers\nwill apply to all of the relevant, outstanding Restricted Notes and not only to particular relevant\nRestricted Notes. If we fail at any time to exercise any of the foregoing rights, that failure will not\nconstitute a waiver of such right. Each such right will be deemed an ongoing right that we may assert at\nany time or at various times. In addition, we will not accept for exchange any Restricted Notes tendered,\nand will not issue Registered Notes in exchange for any such Restricted Notes, if at such time any stop\norder will be threatened or in effect with respect to the registration statement of which this prospectus\nconstitutes a part or the qualification of the Indenture under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as\namended (the \x93 Trust Indenture Act\x94). Procedures for Tendering the Restricted Notes If you wish to\nparticipate in the exchange offers and your Restricted Notes are held by a custodial entity such as a\nbank, broker, dealer, trust company or other nominee, you must instruct that custodial entity to tender\nyour Restricted Notes on your behalf pursuant to the procedures of that custodial entity. Please ensure\nyou contact your custodial entity as soon as possible to give them sufficient time to meet your requested\ndeadline. Beneficial owners are urged to appropriately instruct their bank, broker, custodian or other\nnominee at least five business days prior to the expiration time, as the case may be, in order to allow\nadequate processing time for their instruction. To participate in the exchange offers, you must comply\nwith the ATOP procedures for book-entry transfer described below prior to the expiration time.

In all cases, the exchange of Restricted\nNotes tendered and accepted for exchange pursuant to the exchange offers will be made only after timely\nreceipt by the exchange agent of:\n                                                                          \n      a Book-Entry Confirmation with respect to such Existing Notes; and  \n                                                                          \n                                                  \n      an Agent\x92s Message transmitted through DTC.  \n                                                  \n17\n\nAny acceptance of an Agent\x92s Message transmitted through ATOP is at the election and risk of the person\ntransmitting such Agent\x92s Message and delivery will be deemed made only when actually received by the\nexchange agent. No documents should be sent to us or the trustee. The exchange agent will establish an\naccount with respect to each series of Restricted Notes at DTC for purposes of the exchange offers, and\nany financial institution that is a nominee in DTC, including Euroclear and Clearstream, may make book-\nentry delivery of Restricted Notes by causing DTC to transfer such Restricted Notes into the exchange\nagent\x92s account in accordance with the ATOP procedures for transfer. DTC will then verify the acceptance,\nexecute a book-entry delivery to the exchange agent\x92s account at DTC and send an Agent\x92s Message to the\nexchange agent. The Agent\x92s Message, and any other required documents, must, in any case, be transmitted\nto and received by the exchange agent at or prior to the expiration time in order to be eligible to\nreceive the applicable Registered Notes. The confirmation of a book-entry transfer into the exchange\nagent\x92s account at DTC as described above is referred to herein as a \x93Book-Entry Confirmation.\x94 Delivery\nof documents to DTC or us does not constitute delivery to the exchange agent. The term \x93Agent\x92s Message\x94\nmeans a message transmitted by DTC to, and received by, the exchange agent and forming a part of the\nBook-Entry Confirmation, which states that DTC has received an express and unconditional acknowledgment\nfrom the participant in DTC described in such Agent\x92s Message, stating (i) the aggregate principal amount\nof Restricted Notes that have been tendered by such participant pursuant to the exchange offers, (ii)\nthat such participant has received the prospectus and agrees to be bound by the terms of the exchange\noffers as described in this prospectus and (iii) that we may enforce such agreement against such\nparticipant. If you are a beneficial owner which holds Existing Notes through Euroclear or Clearstream\nand wish to tender your Existing Notes, you are encouraged to contact Euroclear and Clearstream directly\nto ascertain their procedure for tendering Restricted Notes. All questions as to the validity, form,\neligibility, including time of receipt, and acceptance and withdrawal of tendered Restricted Notes will\nbe determined by us in our absolute discretion, which determination will be final and binding, subject to\nholders of Restricted Notes disputing such determination in a court of competent jurisdiction. We reserve\nthe absolute right to reject any and all tendered Restricted Notes determined by us not to be in proper\nform or not to be tendered properly or any tendered Restricted Notes our acceptance of which would, in\nthe opinion of our counsel, be unlawful. We also reserve the right to waive, in our absolute discretion,\nany defects, irregularities or conditions of tender as to particular Restricted Notes, whether or not\nwaived in the case of other Restricted Notes. Our interpretation of the terms and conditions of the\nexchange offers, including the terms and instructions in this prospectus, will be final and binding on\nall parties, subject to holders of Restricted Notes disputing such determination in a court of competent\njurisdiction. Unless waived, any defects or irregularities in connection with tenders of Restricted Notes\nmust be cured within the time we determine. Although we intend to notify holders of defects or\nirregularities with respect to tenders of Restricted Notes, neither we, nor the exchange agent or any\nother person will be under any duty to give that notification or shall incur any liability for failure to\ngive that notification. Tenders of Restricted Notes will not be deemed to have been made until any\ndefects or irregularities therein have been cured or waived. Any holder whose Restricted Notes have been\nmutilated, lost, stolen or destroyed will be responsible for obtaining replacement securities or for\narranging for indemnification with the trustee of the Restricted Notes. Holders may contact the exchange\nagent for assistance with these matters. By tendering its Restricted Notes in connection with the\nexchange offers, each tendering holder of Restricted Notes will be deemed to represent, among other\nthings, that:\n                                                                                                         \n      it is not an affiliate of ours or, if an affiliate of ours, will comply with the registration and  \n      prospectus                                                                                         \n      delivery requirements of the Securities Act to the extent applicable in connection with the        \n      resale of the Registered Notes;                                                                    \n                                                                                                         \n18\n                                                                                     \n      the Registered Notes will be acquired in the ordinary course of its business;  \n                                                                                     \n                                                                                                         \n      it is not participating, does not intend to participate, and has no arrangement or understanding   \n      with anyone to                                                                                     \n      participate, in the distribution (within the meaning of the Securities Act) of the Registered      \n      Notes; and                                                                                         \n                                                                                                         \n                                                                                                         \n      if such holder is a broker-dealer that will receive Registered Notes for its own account in        \n      exchange for                                                                                       \n      Restricted Notes that were acquired as a result of market-making activities or other trading       \n      activities, that it will deliver a prospectus (or to the extent permitted by law, make available   \n      a prospectus to purchasers) in connection with any resale                                          \n      of such Registered Notes.

For purposes of the exchange offers, we will be\ndeemed to have accepted validly tendered Restricted Notes for exchange when, as and if we have given\nwritten notice of such acceptance to the exchange agent. For each Restricted Note accepted for exchange,\nthe holder of the Restricted Note will receive a Registered Note having a principal amount equal to that\nof the surrendered Restricted Note. Restricted Notes accepted for exchange will cease to accrue interest\nfrom and after the date of completion of the exchange offers. Holders of Restricted Notes whose\nRestricted Notes are accepted for exchange will not receive any payment for accrued interest on the\nRestricted Notes otherwise payable on any interest payment date, the record date for which occurs on or\nafter completion of the exchange offers and will be deemed to have waived their rights to receive such\naccrued interest on the Restricted Notes.

In the case of\nRestricted Notes tendered by book-entry transfer in accordance with the book-entry procedures described\nbelow, the non-exchangedRestricted Notes will be returned or recredited promptly after the expiration of\nthe applicable exchange offer. Book-Entry Transfer The exchange agent will make a request to establish an\naccount for the Restricted Notes at DTC for purposes of the exchange offers within two business days\nafter the date of this prospectus. Any financial institution that is a participant in DTC\x92s systems and\nis tendering Restricted Notes must make book-entry delivery of the Restricted Notes by causing DTC to\ntransfer those Restricted Notes into the exchange agent\x92s account at DTC in accordance with DTC\x92s\nprocedures for transfer, including its ATOP procedures. The participant should transmit its acceptance to\nDTC prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the expiration date. DTC will verify this acceptance,\nexecute a book-entry transfer of the tendered Restricted Notes into the exchange agent\x92s account at DTC\nand then send to the exchange agent confirmation of this book-entry transfer, which confirmation must be\nreceived prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the expiration date. The confirmation of this book-\nentry transfer will include an Agent\x92s Message confirming that DTC has received an express 19\n\nacknowledgment from the participant that the participant has received the prospectus and agrees to be\nbound by the terms of the exchange offers described in this prospectus and that we may\nenforce such terms against the participant. Delivery of Registered Notes issued in the exchange offers\nwill be effected through book-entry transfer at DTC.

For a withdrawal to be effective, the\nexchange agent must receive a written notice of withdrawal at one of the addresses set forth below under\n\x93\x97Exchange Agent,\x94\nor the holder must comply with the appropriate procedure of DTC\x92s ATOP system.\n\nAny such notice of withdrawal must specify the name\nof the person who tendered the Restricted Notes to be withdrawn, identify the Restricted Notes to be\nwithdrawn (including the principal amount of such Restricted Notes and the CUSIP numbers and total\nprincipal amount of such Restricted Notes) and\nspecify the name in which such Restricted Notes were registered if different from that of the withdrawing\nholder. Any such notice of withdrawal must also be signed by the person having tendered the Restricted\nNotes to be withdrawn and be accompanied\nby any documents of transfer sufficient to permit the Trustee for the Restricted Notes to register the\ntransfer of these notes into the name of the person having made the original tender and withdrawing the\ntender and, because the Restricted Notes\nhave been tendered through the book-entry procedure, specify the name and number of the participant\x92s\naccount at DTC to be credited if different than that of the person having tendered the Restricted Notes\nto be withdrawn.\n\nAny notice of withdrawal must specify the name and number of the account at DTC to be credited with the\nwithdrawn Restricted Notes and\notherwise comply with the procedures of such facility. We will determine all questions as to the\nvalidity, form and eligibility (including time of receipt) of such notices, and our determination shall\nbe final and binding on all parties. We will\ndeem any Restricted Notes so withdrawn not to have been validly tendered for exchange for purposes of the\nexchange offers. Any Restricted Notes that have been tendered for exchange but that are not exchanged for\nany reason will be credited to an\naccount maintained with DTC for Restricted Notes promptly after withdrawal, rejection of tender or\ntermination of the applicable exchange offer. Properly withdrawn Restricted Notes may be retendered by\nfollowing the procedures described under\n\x93\x97Procedures for Tendering the Restricted Notes\x94 above at any time prior to the expiration time.\n\nExchange Agent\n\nThe Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A.has been appointed as exchange agent for the exchange\noffers.

We will not pay for underwriting\ndiscounts and commissions, brokerage commissions and transfer taxes, if any, relating to the sale\nor disposition of Restricted Notes by a holder.\n\nConsequences of Failure to Exchange\n\nHolders of Restricted Notes who do not exchange their Restricted Notes for Registered Notes under the\nexchange offers will remain subject to\nthe restrictions on transfer of such Restricted Notes as set forth in the legend printed on the\nRestricted Notes as a consequence of the issuance of the Restricted Notes pursuant to the exemptions\nfrom, or in transactions not subject to, the\nregistration requirements of the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws and otherwise as set\nforth in the offering memorandum distributed in connection with the private placement offering of the\nRestricted Notes.\n\nIn general, you may not offer or sell the Restricted Notes unless they are registered under the\nSecurities Act or if the offer or sale is\nexempt from registration under the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws. Except as\nrequired by the Registration Rights Agreement, we do not intend to register resales of the Restricted\nNotes under the Securities Act. Based on\ninterpretations of the SEC staff, Registered Notes issued pursuant to the exchange offers may be offered\nfor resale, resold or otherwise transferred by their holders (other than any such holder that is the\nCompany\x92s \x93affiliate\x94 within\nthe meaning of Rule 405 under the Securities Act) without compliance with the registration and prospectus\ndelivery provisions of the Securities Act; so long as the holders acquired the Registered Notes in the\nordinary course of the holders\x92\nbusiness and the holders have no arrangement or understanding with respect to the distribution of the\nRegistered Notes to be acquired in the exchange offers. Any holder who tenders in the exchange offers for\nthe purpose of participating in a\ndistribution of the Registered Notes could not rely on the applicable interpretations of the SEC and must\ncomply with the registration and prospectus delivery requirements of the Securities Act in connection\nwith a secondary resale transaction.\n\nWe do not currently anticipate that we will register under the Securities Act any Restricted Notes that\nremain outstanding after completion of\nthe exchange offers.

We will expense the costs of the exchange offers and amortize the remaining unamortized\nexpenses related to the issuance of the\nRestricted Notes over the term of the Registered Notes.\n\nAdditional Obligations\n\nIn the Registration Rights Agreement, we agreed that under certain circumstances we would file a shelf\nregistration statement with the SEC\ncovering resales of notes by holders thereof if, for any reason, the exchange\n\n21\n\noffers are not completed on or prior to January 29, 2025 or if, following such date, the Company receives\na written request from certain holders of the Restricted Notes for the filing of a\nshelf registration statement. In such an event, we would be under a continuing obligation to use\ncommercially reasonable efforts to keep the shelf registration statement effective and to provide copies\nof the latest version of the prospectus\ncontained therein to any broker-dealer that requests copies for use in a resale.\n\nOther\n\nParticipation in the exchange offers is voluntary, and you should carefully consider whether to accept.\nYou are urged to consult your financial\nand tax advisors in making your own decision on what action to take. We may in the future seek to acquire\nuntendered Restricted Notes in the open market or privately negotiated transactions, through subsequent\nexchange offers or otherwise. We have\nno present plans to acquire any Restricted Notes that are not tendered in the exchange offers or to file\na registration statement to permit resales of any untendered Restricted Notes.\n\n22\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE NOTES\n\nFor purposes of this section \x93Description of the Notes,\x94 the terms \x93Microsoft,\x94 the\n\x93Company,\x94 \x93we,\x94 \x93us\x94 and \x93our\x94 refer to Microsoft Corporation (parent company only) and not to any of\nits subsidiaries.

For purposes of this paragraph, the applicable Treasury constant maturity or\nmaturities on H.15 shall be deemed to have a maturity date equal to the relevant number of months or\nyears, as applicable, of such Treasury constant maturity from the redemption date. If on the third\nbusiness day preceding the redemption date H.15 or any successor designation or publication is no longer\npublished, Microsoft shall calculate the Treasury Rate based on the rate per annum equal to the semi-\nannual equivalent yield to maturity at 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on the second business day\npreceding such redemption date of the United States Treasury security maturing on, or with a maturity\nthat is closest to, the applicable Par Call Date, as applicable. If there is no United States Treasury\nsecurity maturing on the applicable Par Call Date but there are two or more United States Treasury\nsecurities with a maturity date equally distant from the applicable Par Call Date, one with a maturity\ndate preceding the applicable Par Call Date and one with a maturity date following the applicable Par\nCall Date, Microsoft 25\n\nshall select the United States Treasury security with a maturity date preceding the applicable Par Call\nDate. If there are two or more United States Treasury securities maturing on the applicable Par Call Date\nor two or more United States Treasury securities meeting the criteria of the preceding sentence,\nMicrosoft shall select from among these two or more United States Treasury securities the United States\nTreasury security that is trading closest to par based upon the average of the bid and asked prices for\nsuch United States Treasury securities at 11:00 a.m., New York City time on the applicable date. In\ndetermining the Treasury Rate in accordance with the terms of this paragraph, the semi-annual yield to\nmaturity of the applicable United States Treasury security shall be based upon the average of the bid and\nasked prices (expressed as a percentage of principal amount) at 11:00 a.m., New York City time on the\napplicable date, of such United States Treasury security, and rounded to three decimal places.\nMicrosoft\x92s actions and determinations in determining the redemption price shall be conclusive and\nbinding for all purposes, absent manifest error. Notice of redemption will be mailed or electronically\ndelivered at least 10 but not more than 60 days before the redemption date to each holder of record of\nthe Registered Notes to be redeemed at its registered address. The notice of redemption for the\nRegistered Notes will state, among other things, the amount of Registered Notes to be redeemed, the\nredemption date, conditions to such redemption (if any), the manner in which the redemption price will be\ncalculated and the place or places that payment will be made upon presentation and surrender of notes to\nbe redeemed. Unless Microsoft defaults in the payment of the redemption price, interest will cease to\naccrue on any Registered Notes that have been called for redemption at the redemption date. If less than\nall of the Registered Notes of a series are to be redeemed, the Registered Notes of such series to be\nredeemed will be selected according to DTC procedures, in the case of Registered Notes represented by a\nglobal note, or by lot, in the case of Registered Notes that are not represented by a global note.\nCertain Covenants The Indenture sets forth limited covenants, including the covenant described below,\nthat will apply to each series of Registered Notes. However, these covenants do not, among other things:\n                                                                                                         \n      limit the amount of indebtedness or lease obligations that may be incurred by us and our           \n      subsidiaries;                                                                                      \n                                                                                                         \n                                                                                                         \n      limit our ability or that of our subsidiaries to issue, assume or guarantee debt secured by        \n      liens; or                                                                                          \n                                                                                                         \n                                                                                                         \n      restrict us from paying dividends or making distributions on our capital stock or purchasing or    \n      redeeming our                                                                                      \n      capital stock.                                                                                     \n                                                                                                         \nConsolidation, Merger and Sale of Assets The Indenture provides that we may consolidate with or merge\nwith or into any other person, and may sell, transfer, lease or convey all or substantially all of our\nproperties and assets to another person; providedthat the following conditions are satisfied:\n                                                                                                         \n      we are the continuing entity, or the resulting, surviving or transferee person (the \x93Successor\x94)     \n      is a person organized and existing under the laws of the United States of America, any state       \n      thereof or the District of Columbia and the Successor (if not us) will expressly assume, by        \n      supplemental indenture, all of our obligations under the                                           \n      Registered Notes and the Indenture;                                                                \n                                                                                                         \n                                                                                                         \n      immediately after giving effect to such transaction, no default or event of default under the      \n      Indenture has                                                                                      \n      occurred and is continuing; and                                                                    \n                                                                                                         \n26\n                                                                                                         \n      if requested, the trustee receives from us an officers\x92 certificate and an opinion of counsel that  \n      the                                                                                                \n      merger, consolidation or transfer and such supplemental indenture, as the case may be, complies    \n      with the applicable provisions of the Indenture.                                                   \n                                                                                                         \nIf we consolidate or merge with or into any other person or sell, transfer, lease or convey all or\nsubstantially all of our properties and assets in accordance with the Indenture, the Successor will be\nsubstituted for us in the Indenture, with the same effect as if it had been an original party to the\nIndenture. As a result, the Successor may exercise our rights and powers under the Indenture, and we will\nbe released from all our liabilities and obligations under the Indenture and under the Registered Notes.\nAny substitution of the Successor for us might be deemed for federal income tax purposes to be an\nexchange of the Registered Notes for \x93new\x94 Registered Notes, resulting in recognition of gain or loss for\nsuch purposes and possibly certain other adverse tax consequences to beneficial owners of the Registered\nNotes.

If an event of default with respect to the Notes of any series\n(other than an event of default relating to certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency, or reorganization\nof us) occurs and is continuing, the trustee by notice to us, or the holders of at least 25% in aggregate\nprincipal amount of the outstanding Notes of such series by notice to us and the trustee, may, and the\ntrustee at the request of these holders will, declare the principal of and premium, if any, and accrued\nand unpaid interest on all the Notes of such series to be due and payable. Upon such a declaration, such\nprincipal, premium and accrued and unpaid interest will be due and payable immediately. If an event of\ndefault relating to certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency, or reorganization of us occurs and is\ncontinuing, the principal of and premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes will\nbecome and be immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the trustee\nor any holders. The holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding\nNotes of any series may rescind a declaration of acceleration and its consequences if we have deposited\ncertain sums with the trustee and all events of default with respect to the Notes of such series, other\nthan the non-paymentof the principal or interest which have become due solely by such acceleration, have\nbeen cured or waived, as provided in the Indenture. An event of default for a particular series of debt\nsecurities does not necessarily constitute an event of default for any other series of debt securities\nissued under the Indenture. We are required to furnish the trustee annually a statement by certain of our\nofficers to the effect that, to the best of their knowledge, we are not in default in the fulfillment of\nany of our obligations under the Indenture or, if there has been a default in the fulfillment of any such\nobligation, specifying each such default. No holder of any debt securities of any series will have any\nright to institute any judicial or other proceeding with respect to the Indenture, or for the appointment\nof a receiver or trustee, or for any other remedy unless:\n                                                                                                         \n       an event of default has occurred and is continuing and such holder has given the trustee prior    \n  (1)  written notice                                                                                    \n       of such continuing event of default with respect to the Notes;                                    \n                                                                                                         \n                                                                                                         \n       the holders of not less than 25% of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes of    \n  (2)  such series have                                                                                  \n       requested the trustee to institute proceedings in respect of such event of default;               \n                                                                                                         \n                                                                                                         \n       the trustee has been offered indemnity reasonably satisfactory to it against its costs, expenses  \n  (3)  and                                                                                               \n       liabilities in complying with such request;                                                       \n                                                                                                         \n                                                                                                         \n       the trustee has failed to institute proceedings 60 days after the receipt of such notice,         \n  (4)  request and offer of                                                                              \n       indemnity; and                                                                                    \n                                                                                                         \n                                                                                                         \n       no direction inconsistent with such written request has been given for 60 days by the holders of  \n  (5)  a majority in                                                                                     \n       aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes of such series.                               \n                                                                                                         \nThe holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of outstanding Notes of a particular series will\nhave the right, subject to certain limitations, to direct the time, method and place of conducting any\nproceeding for any remedy available to the trustee with respect to the debt securities of that series or\nexercising any trust or power 28\n\nconferred to the trustee, and to waive certain defaults. The Indenture provides that if an event of\ndefault occurs and is continuing, the trustee will exercise such of its rights and powers under the\nIndenture, and use the same degree of care and skill in their exercise, as a prudent person would\nexercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of such person\x92s own affairs.

Notwithstanding the foregoing,\nthe holder of the Registered Notes will have an absolute and unconditional right to receive payment of\nthe principal of and premium, if any, and interest on the Registered Notes and to institute suit for the\nenforcement of payment. Modification and Waivers Modification and amendments of the Indenture and the\nNotes may be made by us and the trustee with the consent of the holders of not less than a majority in\naggregate principal amount of the Notes of each series affected thereby;

The holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal\namount of the outstanding Notes of a series may, on behalf of the holders of all Notes of that series,\nwaive any past default and its consequences under the Indenture with respect to that series of Notes,\nexcept a default (1) in the payment of principal or premium, if any, or interest on that series of Notes\nor (2) in respect of a covenant or provision of the Indenture that cannot be modified or amended without\nthe consent of the holder of each Note of that series. Upon any such waiver, such default will cease to\nexist, and any event of default arising therefrom will be deemed to have been cured, for every purpose of\nthe Indenture; however, no such waiver will extend to any subsequent or other default or event of default\nor impair any rights consequent thereon. Book-Entry; Delivery and Form; Global Securities Each series of\nRegistered Notes will be issued in the form of one or more global securities, in definitive, fully\nregistered form without interest coupons, each of which we refer to as a \x93global security.\x94 Each such\nglobal security will be deposited with the trustee as custodian for DTC and registered in the name of a\nnominee of DTC in New York, New York for the accounts of participants in DTC. We will not issue\ncertificated securities to you for the Registered Notes you purchase, except in the limited circumstances\ndescribed below. Each global security will be issued to DTC, which will keep a computerized record of its\nparticipants whose clients have purchased and beneficially own Registered Notes of a particular series.\nEach participant will then keep a record of its clients who have purchased and beneficially own\nRegistered Notes of a particular series. Unless it is exchanged in whole or in part for a certificated\nsecurity, a global security may not be transferred. DTC, its nominee and their successors may, however,\ntransfer a global security as a whole to one another, and these transfers are required to be recorded on\nour records or a register to be maintained by the trustee. DTC has advised us as follows: DTC is a\nlimited-purpose trust company organized under New York Banking Law, a \x93banking organization\x94 within the\nmeaning of the New York Banking Law, a member of the Federal Reserve System, a \x93clearing corporation\x94\nwithin the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code and a \x93clearing agency\x94 registered pursuant to\nthe provisions of Section 17A of the Exchange Act. DTC was created to hold securities of institutions\nthat have accounts with DTC (\x93 participants\x94) and to facilitate the clearance and settlement of\nsecurities transactions among its participants in such securities through electronic 30\n\nbook-entry changes in accounts of the participants, thereby eliminating the need for physical movement of\nsecurities certificates. DTC\x92s participants include both U.S. and non-U.S. securities brokers and\ndealers, banks, trust companies, clearing corporations and certain other organizations. Access to DTC\x92s\nbook-entry system is also available to others such as both U.S. and non-U.S. securities brokers and\ndealers, banks, trust companies and clearing corporations that clear through or maintain a custodial\nrelationship with a participant, whether directly or indirectly.\n\nOwnership of Beneficial Interests\n\nUpon\nthe issuance of each global security, DTC will credit, on its book-entry registration and transfer\nsystem, the respective principal amount of the individual beneficial interests represented by the global\nsecurity to the accounts of participants.\nOwnership of beneficial interests in each global security will be limited to participants or persons that\nmay hold interests through participants. Beneficial interests in a global security will be shown on, and\ntransfers of beneficial interests in\nthe global securities will be made only through, records maintained by DTC and its participants. When you\npurchase notes through the DTC system, the purchases must be made by or through a direct participant,\nwhich will receive credit for the notes\non DTC\x92s records. When you actually purchase the Registered Notes, you will become its beneficial owner.\nYour ownership interest will be recorded only on the direct or indirect participants\x92 records. DTC will\nhave no knowledge of your\nindividual ownership of Registered Notes. DTC\x92s records will show only the identity of the direct\nparticipants and the amount of Registered Notes held by or through them. You will not receive a written\nconfirmation of your purchase or sale or\nany periodic account statement directly from DTC. You should instead receive these from your direct or\nindirect participant. As a result, the direct or indirect participants are responsible for keeping\naccurate account of the holdings of their\ncustomers.\n\nSo long as DTC or its nominee is the registered holder and owner of a global security, DTC or such\nnominee, as the case may\nbe, will be considered the sole legal owner of the Registered Notes represented by the global security\nfor all purposes under the Indenture, the Registered Notes and applicable law. Except as set forth below,\nowners of beneficial interests in a\nglobal security will not be entitled to receive certificated Registered Notes and will not be considered\nto be the owners or holders of any Registered Notes represented by the global security. We understand\nthat under existing industry practice, in\nthe event an owner of a beneficial interest in a global security desires to take any actions that DTC, as\nthe holder of the global security, is entitled to take, DTC would authorize the participants to take such\naction, and that participants would\nauthorize beneficial owners owning through such participants to take such action or would otherwise act\nupon the instructions of beneficial owners owning through them. No beneficial owner of an interest in a\nglobal security will be able to transfer\nsuch interest except in accordance with DTC\x92s applicable procedures, in addition to those provided for\nunder the Indenture. Because DTC can only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf of\nothers, the ability of a person having\na beneficial interest in a global security to pledge that interest to persons that do not participate in\nthe DTC system, or otherwise to take actions in respect of that interest, may be impaired by the lack of\na physical certificate representing\nthat interest.\n\nAll payments on the Registered Notes represented by a global security registered in the name of and held\nby DTC or its\nnominee will be made to DTC or its nominee, as the case may be, as the registered owner and holder of the\nglobal security.\n\nThe trustee\nwill wire payments on the Registered Notes to DTC\x92s nominee. The trustee and we will treat DTC\x92s nominee\nas the owner of each global security for all purposes. Accordingly, the trustee, any paying agent and we\nwill have no direct\nresponsibility or liability to pay amounts due on a global security to you or any other beneficial owners\nin that global security. Any redemption notices will be sent by us directly to DTC, which will, in turn,\ninform the direct participants (or the\nindirect participants), which will then contact you as a beneficial holder.\n\nIt is DTC\x92s current practice, upon receipt of any\npayment of principal, interest, redemption prices, distributions or liquidation amounts, to credit direct\nparticipants\x92 accounts proportionately on the payment date\n\n31\n\nbased on their holdings. In addition, it is DTC\x92s current practice to pass through any consenting or\nvoting rights to such participants by using an omnibus proxy. Those participants will, in turn, make\npayments to and solicit votes from you, the beneficial owner of notes, based on their customary\npractices. Payments to you will be the responsibility of the participants and not of DTC, the trustee or\nour company. Unless and until it is exchanged in whole or in part for certificated Registered Notes, each\nglobal security may not be transferred except as a whole by DTC to a nominee of DTC or by a nominee of\nDTC to DTC or another nominee of DTC. Transfers between participants in DTC will be effected in the\nordinary way in accordance with DTC rules and will be settled in same-dayfunds. We expect that DTC will\ntake any action permitted to be taken by a holder of Registered Notes only at the direction of one or\nmore participants to whose account the DTC interests in a global security are credited and only in\nrespect of such portion of the aggregate principal amount of the Registered Notes as to which such\nparticipant or participants has or have given such direction. However, if there is an event of default\nunder the Registered Notes, DTC will exchange each global security for certificated Registered Notes,\nwhich it will distribute to its participants. Although we expect that DTC will agree to the foregoing\nprocedures in order to facilitate transfers of interests in each global security among participants of\nDTC, DTC is under no obligation to perform or continue to perform such procedures, and such procedures\nmay be discontinued at any time. None of we, the dealer managers or the trustee will have any\nresponsibility for the performance or nonperformance by DTC or its participants or indirect participants\nof their respective obligations under the rules and procedures governing their operations. The Indenture\nprovides that the global securities will be exchanged for Notes in certificated form of like tenor and of\nan equal principal amount, in authorized denominations in the following limited circumstances:\n                                                                                                         \n       DTC notifies us that it is unwilling or unable to continue as depository or if DTC ceases to be   \n  (i)  eligible under                                                                                    \n       the Indenture and we do not appoint a successor depository within 90 days;                        \n                                                                                                         \n                                                                                                         \n        we determine that the Notes will no longer be represented by global securities and execute and   \n  (ii)  deliver to the                                                                                   \n        trustee an order to such effect; or                                                              \n                                                                                                         \n                                                                                              \n  (iii)  an event of default with respect to the Notes will have occurred and be continuing.  \n                                                                                              \nThese certificated Notes will be registered in such name or names as DTC will instruct the trustee. It is\nexpected that such instructions may be based upon directions received by DTC from participants with\nrespect to ownership of beneficial interests in global securities. The information in this section of\nthis prospectus concerning DTC and DTC\x92s book-entry system has been obtained from sources that we believe\nto be reliable, but we do not take responsibility for this information. Euroclear and Clearstream If the\ndepositary for a global security is DTC, you may hold interests in the global security through\nClearstream Banking, société anonyme, which we refer to as \x93 Clearstream,\x94 or Euroclear Bank S.A./N.V.,\nas operator of the Euroclear System, which we refer to as \x93 Euroclear,\x94 in each case, as a participant in\nDTC. Euroclear and Clearstream will hold interests, in each case, on behalf of their participants through\ncustomers\x92 securities accounts in the names of Euroclear and Clearstream on the books of their respective\ndepositaries, which in turn will hold such interests in customers\x92 securities in the depositaries\x92 names\non DTC\x92s books. Links have been established among DTC, Clearstream and Euroclear to facilitate the\ninitial issuance of the Registered Notes sold outside of the United States and cross-market transfers of\nthe notes associated with secondary market trading. 32\n\nAlthough DTC, Clearstream and Euroclear have agreed to the procedures described below in\norder to facilitate transfers, they are under no obligation to perform these procedures, and these\nprocedures may be modified or discontinued at any time.\n\nClearstream and Euroclear will record the ownership interests of their participants in much the same way\nas DTC, and DTC will record the total\nownership of each of the U.S. agents of Clearstream and Euroclear, as participants in DTC. When\nRegistered Notes are to be transferred from the account of a DTC participant to the account of a\nClearstream participant or a Euroclear participant, the\npurchaser must send instructions to Clearstream or Euroclear through a participant at least one day prior\nto settlement. Clearstream or Euroclear, as the case may be, will instruct its U.S. agent to receive\nRegistered Notes against payment. After\nsettlement, Clearstream or Euroclear will credit its participant\x92s account. Credit for the Registered\nNotes will appear on the next day (European time).\n\nBecause settlement is taking place during New York business hours, DTC participants will be able to\nemploy their usual procedures for sending\nRegistered Notes to the relevant U.S. agent acting for the benefit of Clearstream or Euroclear\nparticipants. The sale proceeds will be available to the DTC seller on the settlement date. As a result,\nto the DTC participant, a cross-market\ntransaction will settle no differently than a trade between two DTC participants.\n\nWhen a Clearstream or Euroclear participant wishes to\ntransfer Registered Notes to a DTC participant, the seller will be required to send instructions to\nClearstream or Euroclear through a participant at least one business day prior to settlement. In these\ncases, Clearstream or Euroclear will instruct\nits U.S. agent to transfer these Registered Notes against payment for them. The payment will then be\nreflected in the account of the Clearstream or Euroclear participant the following day, with the proceeds\nback-valued to the value date, which would\nbe the preceding day, when settlement occurs in New York. If settlement is not completed on the intended\nvalue date, that is, the trade fails, proceeds credited to the Clearstream or Euroclear participant\x92s\naccount will instead be valued as of\nthe actual settlement date.\n\nYou should be aware that you will only be able to make and receive deliveries, payments and other\ncommunications involving the Registered Notes through Clearstream and Euroclear on the days when those\nclearing systems are open for business. Those systems may not be open for business on days when banks,\nbrokers and other institutions are open for\nbusiness in the United States. In addition, because of time zone differences there may be problems with\ncompleting transactions involving Clearstream and Euroclear on the same business day as in the United\nStates.\n\nDischarge, Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance\n\nWe may discharge certain obligations to holders of the Notes of a series that have not already been\ndelivered to the trustee for cancellation\nand that either have become due and payable or will become due and payable within one year (or scheduled\nfor redemption within one year) by depositing with the trustee, in trust, funds in U.S. dollars in an\namount sufficient to pay the entire\nindebtedness including the principal and premium, if any, and interest to the date of such deposit (if\nthe Notes have become due and payable) or to the maturity thereof or the redemption date of the Notes of\nthat series, as the case may be. We may\ndirect the trustee to invest such funds in U.S. Treasury securities with a maturity of one year or less\nor in a money market fund that invests solely in short-term U.S. Treasury securities.\n\nThe Indenture provides that we may elect either (1) to defease and be discharged from any and all\nobligations with respect to the Notes\nof a series (except for, among other things, obligations to register the transfer or exchange of the\nNotes, to replace temporary or mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Notes, to maintain an office or\nagency with respect to the Notes and to hold\nmoneys for payment in trust) (\x93legal defeasance\x94) or (2) to be released from our obligations to comply\nwith the restrictive covenants under the Indenture, and any omission to comply with such obligations will\nnot constitute a\ndefault or an event of default with respect to the\n\n33\n\nNotes of a series and clause (4) under the heading \x93Events of Default\x94 in the Indenture will no longer be\napplied (\x93covenant defeasance\x94). Legal defeasance or\ncovenant defeasance, as the case may be, will be conditioned upon, among other things, the irrevocable\ndeposit by us with the trustee, in trust, of an amount in U.S. dollars, or U.S. government obligations,\nor both, applicable to the Notes of that\nseries which through the scheduled payment of principal and interest in accordance with their terms will\nprovide money in an amount sufficient to pay the principal or premium, if any, and interest on the Notes\non the scheduled due dates therefor.\n\nIf we effect covenant defeasance with respect to the Notes of any series, the amount in U.S. dollars, or\nU.S. government obligations, or\nboth, on deposit with the trustee will be sufficient, in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm of\nindependent accountants, to pay amounts due on the Notes of that series at the time of the stated\nmaturity but may not be sufficient to pay\namounts due on the Notes of that series at the time of the acceleration resulting from such event of\ndefault. However, we would remain liable to make payment of such amounts due at the time of acceleration.\n\nWe will be required to deliver to the trustee an opinion of counsel that the deposit and related\ndefeasance will not cause the holders of the\nNotes of that series to recognize gain or loss for federal income tax purposes. If we elect legal\ndefeasance, that opinion of counsel must be based upon a ruling from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service or\na change in law to that effect.\n\nWe may exercise our legal defeasance option notwithstanding our prior exercise of our covenant defeasance\noption.\n\nTrustee, Paying Agent and Security Registrar\n\nThe Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. is the trustee, paying agent and security registrar for\nthe Registered Notes offered hereby.\nThe Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. is a national banking association organized under and\ngoverned by the laws of the United States of America, and provides trust services and acts as indenture\ntrustee for numerous corporate securities\nissuances, including for other series of debt securities of which we are the issuer.\n\nGoverning Law\n\nThe Indenture is, and the Registered Notes upon issuance will be, governed by and construed in accordance\nwith the laws of the State of New\nYork.\n\n34\n\nEXCHANGE OFFERS; REGISTRATION RIGHTS\n\nOn November 6, 2023, the Company and BofA Securities, Inc., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, Wells Fargo\nSecurities, LLC, Academy Securities,\nInc., CastleOak Securities, L.P., Drexel Hamilton, LLC, Loop Capital Markets LLC, MFR Securities, Inc.,\nMischler Financial Group, Inc., RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Samuel A Ramirez & Company, Inc. and Siebert\nWilliams Shank & Co.,\nLLC, as dealer managers, entered into the Registration Rights Agreement with respect to the Restricted\nNotes. In the Registration Rights Agreement, the Company agreed, among other things, for the benefit of\nthe holders of the Restricted Notes to use\ncommercially reasonable efforts to (1) cause to be filed a registration statement on Form S-4 with\nrespect to a registered offer to exchange each series of Restricted Notes for Registered Notes, with\nterms substantially identical in all material respects to such series of Restricted Notes (except that\nthe Registered Notes will not contain terms with respect to transfer restrictions or any increase in\nannual interest rate) and (2) cause such\nregistration statement become effective under the Securities Act by January 29, 2025.\n\nIf the SEC declares the registration statement\nof which this prospectus forms a part effective, the Company will offer the Registered Notes in exchange\nfor the Restricted Notes. Each of the exchange offers will remain open for at least 20 business days from\nthe date such prospectus is mailed\nand/or electronically delivered. For each Restricted Note surrendered to the Company under the exchange\noffers, the holders of such Restricted Note will receive a Registered Note of such series of equal\nprincipal amount. Interest on the Registered\nNotes will be payable semi-annually and will accrue from the most recent interest payment date on which\ninterest was paid on the applicable series of Restricted Notes prior to the date such series of\nRegistered Notes are issued, which was\nDecember 15, 2023 in the case of the Registered 2027 Notes and the Registered 2047 Notes and March 15,\n2024 in the case of the Registered 2026 Notes, the Registered 2030 Notes and the Registered 2050 Notes. A\nholder of registrable\nsecurities that participates in the exchange offers will be deemed to make certain representations to us.\nThe Company will use commercially reasonable efforts to complete the exchange offers not later than 60\ndays after the registration statement\nbecomes effective.\n\nUnder existing interpretations of the SEC contained in several no-action\nletters to third parties, the Registered Notes will be freely transferable after the exchange offers\nwithout further registration under the Securities Act, except that any broker-dealer that participates in\nthe exchange offers must deliver a\nprospectus meeting the requirements of the Securities Act when it resells the Registered Notes. In\naddition, under applicable interpretations of the staff of the SEC, the Company\x92s affiliates will not be\npermitted to exchange their Restricted\nNotes for Registered Notes in the exchange offers.\n\nThe Company will agree to make available, during the period required by the Securities\nAct, a prospectus meeting the requirements of the Securities Act for use by participating broker-dealers\nand other persons, if any, with similar prospectus delivery requirements for use in connection with any\nresale of the Registered Notes.\nRestricted Notes of any series not tendered in the exchange offers will continue to bear interest at the\nrate set forth in the Indenture with respect to such series of Restricted Notes and be subject to all the\nterms and conditions specified in the\nIndenture, including transfer restrictions, but will not retain any rights under the Registration Rights\nAgreement (including with respect to increases in annual interest rate described below) after the\nconsummation of the exchange offers.\n\nIf for any reason the exchange offers are not completed on or prior to January 29, 2025 or if, following\nsuch date, the Company receives\na written request from certain holders of the Restricted Notes for the filing of a shelf registration\nstatement, then the Company will use commercially reasonable efforts to file and to have become effective\na shelf registration statement relating\nto resales of the Restricted Notes and to keep that shelf registration statement effective until the date\nthat the Restricted Notes cease to be \x93registrable securities\x94 (as defined below). The Company will, in\nthe event of such a shelf\nregistration, provide to each participating holder of Restricted Notes copies of a prospectus, notify\neach participating holder of Restricted Notes when the shelf registration statement has become effective\nand take certain other actions to permit\nresales of the Restricted Notes. A holder of registrable securities that sells Restricted Notes under the\nshelf registration statement\n\n35\n\ngenerally will be deemed to make certain representations to the Company, to be named as a selling\nsecurity holder in the related prospectus and to deliver a prospectus to purchasers, will be\nsubject to certain of the civil liability provisions under the Securities Act in connection with those\nsales and will be bound by the provisions of the Registration Rights Agreement that are applicable to\nsuch a holder of registrable securities\n(including certain indemnification obligations). Holders of registrable securities will also be required\nto suspend their use of the prospectus included in the shelf registration statement under specified\ncircumstances upon receipt of notice from\nthe Company.\n\nIf a \x93registration default\x94 (as defined below) occurs with respect to a series of registrable securities,\nthen\nadditional interest shall accrue on the principal amount of the Restricted Notes of a particular series\nthat are registrable securities at a rate of 0.25% per annum for the first 90-day period beginning on the\nday immediately following such registration default (which rate will be increased by an additional 0.25%\nper annum for each subsequent 90-day period that such additional interest continues to accrue; however,\nthe rate at which such additional interest accrues may in no event exceed 1.00% per annum). The\nadditional interest will cease to accrue when the registration defaults end. A \x93registration default\x94\noccurs if (i) the exchange\noffer registered on a registration statement on Form S-4 for the Restricted Notes validly tendered in\naccordance with the terms of such registration statement is not completed on or prior to January 29,\n2025 or, if a shelf registration statement is required, such shelf registration statement is not declared\neffective on or prior to the 60th day after the later of (A) January 29, 2025 and (B) the date on which\nthe Company receives a\nwritten request from certain holders of the Restricted Notes for the filing of a shelf registration\nstatement or (ii) if applicable, a shelf registration statement covering resales of the Restricted Notes\nhas been declared effective and such\nshelf registration statement ceases to be effective or the prospectus contained therein ceases to be\nusable for resales of registrable securities (A) on more than two occasions of at least 30 consecutive\ndays during the required effectiveness\nperiod as described therein or (B) at any time in any 12-month period during the required effectiveness\nperiod as described therein and such failure to remain effective or be so usable exists for more\nthan 90 days (whether or not consecutive) in any 12-month period. A registration default ends with\nrespect to a series of Restricted Notes when such Restricted Note ceases to be a registrable security or,\nif\nearlier, in the case of a registration default under clause (ii) of the definition thereof, when the\nregistration statement again becomes effective or the prospectus again becomes usable as permitted by the\ndefinition thereof.\n\nThe Registration Rights Agreement defines \x93registrable securities\x94 initially to mean the Restricted Notes\nand provides that the\nRestricted Notes will cease to be registrable securities upon the earliest to occur of the following: (i)\nwhen a registration statement with respect to such Restricted Notes has become effective and such\nRestricted Notes have been exchanged or\ndisposed of pursuant to such registration statement, (ii) when such Restricted Notes cease to be\noutstanding or (iii) when such Restricted Notes have been resold pursuant to Rule 144 under the\nSecurities Act (but not Rule 144A) without\nregard to volume restrictions, provided the Company shall have removed or caused to be removed any\nrestrictive legend on the Restricted Notes.\n\nAny amounts of additional interest due will be payable in cash on the same original interest payment\ndates as interest on the Restricted Notes\nis payable.\n\nThis summary of the provisions of the Registration Rights Agreement does not purport to be complete and\nis subject to, and is\nqualified in its entirety to, all the provisions of the Registration Rights Agreement.\n\n36\n\nMATERIAL U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS\n\nThe following is a general discussion of certain material U.S. federal income tax considerations relating\nto the exchange of Restricted Notes\nfor Registered Notes in the exchange offers. It does not purport to contain a complete analysis of all\nthe potential tax considerations relating to the exchange. This discussion is based upon the provisions\nof the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986,\nas amended (the \x93Code\x94), proposed, temporary and final Treasury regulations promulgated under the Code,\nand administrative rulings and judicial decisions, in each case as of the date of this prospectus. These\nauthorities are subject\nto differing interpretations and may be changed, perhaps retroactively, resulting in U.S. federal income\ntax consequences different from those discussed below.\n\nThis discussion is for general purposes only. All holders are urged to consult with their tax advisors as\nto the specific tax consequences to them of the exchange of Restricted Notes for Registered Notes in\nlight of their particular facts and circumstances, including the applicability and effect of any U.S.\nfederal, state, local, foreign or other tax laws.\n\nConsequences of Tendering Restricted Notes\n\nThe exchange of Restricted Notes for Registered Notes in the exchange offers will not constitute a\ntaxable exchange for U.S. federal income\ntax purposes. Accordingly, you will not recognize gain or loss upon the exchange of Restricted Notes for\nRegistered Notes, your basis in the Registered Notes will be the same as your basis in the Restricted\nNotes surrendered in exchange therefor\nimmediately before the exchange, and your holding period in the Registered Notes will include your\nholding period for the Restricted Notes exchanged.\n\n37\n\nPLAN OF DISTRIBUTION\n\nEach broker-dealer that receives Registered Notes for its own account pursuant to the exchange offers\nwill be deemed to acknowledge that it\nwill deliver a prospectus in connection with any resale of such Registered Notes. This prospectus, as it\nmay be amended or supplemented from time to time, may be used by a broker-dealer in connection with\nresales of Registered Notes received in\nexchange for Restricted Notes that were acquired by such broker-dealer as a result of market-making or\nother trading activities. Microsoft has agreed that, for a period of up to 180 days after the expiration\ndate of the exchange offers, if requested\nby one or more such broker-dealers, Microsoft will amend or supplement this prospectus in order to\nexpedite or facilitate the disposition of any Registered Notes by any such broker-dealers.\n\nMicrosoft will not receive any proceeds from any sale of Registered Notes by broker-dealers. Registered\nNotes received by broker-dealers for\ntheir own account pursuant to the exchange offers may be sold from time to time in one or more\ntransactions in the over-the-counter market, in negotiated transactions,\nthrough the writing of options on the Registered Notes or a combination of such methods of resale, at\nmarket prices prevailing at the time of resale, at prices related to such prevailing market prices or at\nnegotiated prices. Any such resale may be\nmade directly to purchasers or to or through brokers or dealers who may receive compensation in the form\nof commissions or concessions from any such broker-dealer or the purchasers of any such Registered Notes.\nAny broker-dealer that resells\nRegistered Notes that were received by it for its own account pursuant to the exchange offers, and any\nbroker or dealer that participates in a distribution of such Registered Notes may be deemed to be an\n\x93underwriter\x94 within the meaning of\nthe Securities Act, and any profit on any such resale of Registered Notes and any commissions or\nconcessions received by any such persons may be deemed to be underwriting compensation under the\nSecurities Act.\n\nEach broker-dealer that receives Registered Notes for its own account pursuant to the exchange offers\nwill be deemed to acknowledge that it\nwill deliver a prospectus in connection with any resale of such Registered Notes and by so acknowledging\nand by delivering a prospectus, a broker-dealer will not be deemed to admit that it is an \x93underwriter\x94\nwithin the meaning of the\nSecurities Act.\n\nFor a period of 180 days after the expiration date of the exchange offers, Microsoft will promptly send\nadditional copies\nof this prospectus and any amendment or supplement to this prospectus to any broker-dealer that requests\nsuch documents in writing to the exchange agent. Microsoft has agreed to pay certain expenses incident to\nthe exchange offers (including the\nexpenses of one counsel for the holders of the Registered Notes) other than commissions or concessions of\nany brokers or dealers and Microsoft will indemnify the holders of the Registered Notes (including any\nbroker-dealers) against certain\nliabilities pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement, including liabilities under the Securities\nAct.\n\n38\n\nLEGAL MATTERS\n\nThe validity of the Registered Notes will be passed upon for us by Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP, Palo\nAlto, California, and, with\nrespect to matters of Washington law, by Keith R. Dolliver, Esq. our Deputy General Counsel.\n\nMr. Dolliver beneficially owns, or has\nthe right to acquire, an aggregate of less than 0.01% of the common stock of Microsoft Corporation.\n\nEXPERTS\n\nThe financial statements of Microsoft Corporation as of June 30, 2023 and June 30, 2022, and for each of\nthe three years in\nthe period ended June 30, 2023 incorporated by reference in this Prospectus, and the effectiveness of\nMicrosoft Corporation\x92s internal control over financial reporting have been audited by Deloitte & Touche\nLLP, an independent\nregistered public accounting firm, as stated in their reports. Such financial statements are incorporated\nby reference in reliance upon the reports of such firm given their authority as experts in accounting and\nauditing.\n\nWith respect to the unaudited interim financial information for the periods ended September 30, 2023 and\n2022, December 31, 2023 and\n2022, and March 31, 2024 and 2023, which is incorporated by reference herein, Deloitte & Touche LLP, an\nindependent registered public accounting firm, have applied limited procedures in accordance with the\nstandards of the Public\nCompany Accounting Oversight Board (United States) for a review of such information. However, as stated\nin their reports included in the Company\x92s Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended\nSeptember 30, 2023, December 31, 2023, and March 31, 2024 and incorporated by reference herein, they did\nnot audit and they do not express an opinion on that interim financial information. Accordingly, the\ndegree of reliance on their\nreports on such information should be restricted in light of the limited nature of the review procedures\napplied. Deloitte & Touche LLP is not subject to the liability provisions of Section 11 of the Securities\nAct of 1933 for their\nreports on the unaudited interim financial information because those reports are not \x93reports\x94 or a\n\x93part\x94 of the Registration Statement prepared or certified by an accountant within the meaning of\nSections 7 and 11 of the\nSecurities Act of 1933.\n\n39\n\nWHERE YOU CAN FIND MORE INFORMATION We file annual, quarterly and current reports, proxy statements and\nother business and financial information with the SEC.

Indemnification of Directors and Officers\nSections 23B.08.510 and 23B.08.570 of the Washington Business Corporation Act (\x93 WBCA\x94) authorizes\nWashington corporations to indemnify their officers and directors under certain circumstances against\nexpenses and liabilities incurred in legal proceedings involving them as a result of their service as an\nofficer or director. Section 23B.08.560 of the WBCA authorizes a corporation by provision in its articles\nof incorporation to indemnify or agree to indemnify a director made a party to a proceeding, or obligate\nitself to advance or reimburse expenses incurred in a proceeding, without regard to the limitations\nimposed by Sections 23B.08.510 through .550 of the WBCA; provided, however, that no such indemnity shall\nbe made for or on account of (a) acts or omissions of the director finally adjudged to be intentional\nmisconduct or a knowing violation of law, (b) conduct of the director finally adjudged to be in violation\nof Section 23B.08.310 of the WBCA (relating to unlawful distributions) or (c) any transaction with\nrespect to which it was finally adjudged that the director personally received a benefit in money,\nproperty, or services to which the director is not legally entitled. The Registrant\x92s Amended and\nRestated Articles of Incorporation require indemnification of the Registrant\x92s officers and directors and\nadvancement of expenses to the fullest extent not prohibited by applicable law. The Registrant\x92s Amended\nand Restated Articles of Incorporation provide for procedures for those seeking indemnification and/or\nadvancement of expenses. In addition, as authorized by Section 23B.08.320 of the WBCA, the Registrant\x92s\nAmended and Restated Articles of Incorporation contain a provision eliminating the personal liability of\ndirectors to the Registrant or its shareholders for monetary damages for conduct as a director, except\nfor (a) omissions involving intentional misconduct by the director or a knowing violation of law by the\ndirector, (b) conduct violating Section 23B.08.310 of the WBCA or (c) any transaction from which the\ndirector will personally receive a benefit in money, property or services to which the director is not\nlegally entitled. The Registrant has established an indemnification trust (\x93 2016 Directors \x92 Trust\x94) to\nfund the Registrant\x92s obligations to indemnify and/or advance expenses to directors arising from their\nboard service in the event the Registrant does not or is financially unable to provide the\nindemnification and/or advancement. As required by the 2016 Directors\x92 Trust agreement, the Registrant\nhas funded a minimum balance of principal assets of no less than $50 million in the trust. The Registrant\nalso has an indemnification trust (\x93 2016 Officers \x92 Trust\x94) that funds the Registrant\x92s indemnification\nobligations to certain past and present officers arising from their activities as such. As required by\nthe 2016 Officers\x92 Trust agreement, the Registrant has funded a minimum balance of principal assets of no\nless than $50 million in the trust. The 2016 Directors\x92 Trust and 2016 Officers\x92 Trust are successors to\ncertain trusts originally established in 1993, and amended from time to time, to fund Registrant\x92s\nindemnification obligations to directors and officers. The Registrant has also entered into separate\nindemnification agreements with certain of its directors and executive officers. Item 21.

Tenders of\nExisting\n\nNotes in the Exchange Offers may be validly withdrawn at any time at or prior to the Expiration Time, but\nwill thereafter be irrevocable, except in certain limited circumstances where additional withdrawal\nrights are required by law. The consummation of each Exchange Offer is subject to, and conditional upon,\nthe satisfaction or, where permitted, the waiver of the conditions discussed under \x93Description of the\nExchange Offers\x97Conditions to the Exchange Offers,\x94 including, among other things, the registration\nstatement on Form S-4of which this prospectus forms a part having been declared effective by the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission (the \x93SEC\x94) on or prior to the Expiration Time and remaining effective\non the Settlement Date (as defined in this prospectus). We may, at our option waive any such conditions\nat or by the Expiration Time, except the condition that the registration statement of which this\nprospectus forms a part has been declared effective by the SEC on or prior to the Expiration Time and\nremains effective on the Settlement Date. For information about other conditions to our obligations to\ncomplete the Exchange Offers, see \x93Description of the Exchange Offers\x97Conditions to the Exchange Offers.\x94\nFor a discussion of factors you should consider in determining whether to tender your Existing Notes in\nconnection with the Exchange Offers, see the information under \x93 Risk Factors\x94 beginning on page 13 of\nthis prospectus and in our Annual Report on Form 10-Kand Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q,which are\nincorporated by reference into this prospectus. None of Microsoft, the Dealer Managers, the Exchange\nAgent and Information Agent (each as defined in this prospectus) for the Exchange Offers, or the trustee\nunder the Indenture (as defined in this prospectus), or any other person makes any recommendation as to\nwhether you should exchange your Existing Notes in the Exchange Offers. Neither the SEC nor any state\nsecurities commission has approved or disapproved of these securities or passed upon the accuracy or\nadequacy of this prospectus. Any representation to the contrary is a criminal offense. The Joint Lead\nDealer Managers for the Exchange Offers are:\n                                            \n  Morgan Stanley    Wells Fargo Securities  \n                                            \nThe date of this prospectus is February 16, 2021.\n\nThe Exchange Offers\n\nAs of February 12, 2021, the aggregate principal amounts of Pool 1 Notes and Pool 2 Notes outstanding\nwere $17,898.6 million and\n$3,958.9 million, respectively. The aggregate principal amount of New Notes to be issued pursuant to the\nExchange Offers will be subject to the applicable New Issue Cap (as described below). We may in our sole\ndiscretion, subject to applicable\nlaw, increase either or both of the New 2052 Notes Issue Caps or the New 2062 Notes Issue Cap. The\nprincipal amount of each series of Existing Notes to be accepted pursuant to the Exchange Offers will be\nsubject to the \x93acceptance priority\nlevel\x94 (in numerical priority order) of such series as set forth in the applicable table on the front\ncover of this prospectus.\n\nWith respect\nto Existing Notes tendered in an Exchange Offer, and not validly withdrawn prior to the Expiration Time,\nsuch Existing Notes of a series having a higher acceptance priority level for such Exchange Offer will be\naccepted for exchange before any such\nExisting Notes of a series having a lower acceptance priority level. If acceptance of all validly\ntendered Existing Notes of a series would not result in us issuing New Notes having an aggregate\nprincipal amount in excess of the applicable New Issue\nCap, we will accept all validly tendered Existing Notes of such series. If acceptance of all validly\ntendered Existing Notes of a series would result in us issuing New Notes having an aggregate principal\namount in excess of the applicable New Issue\nCap, the tendered Existing Notes of such series will be accepted subject to proration as described more\nfully in this prospectus.\n\nThe completion of\nthe Exchange Offers for each series of Existing Notes is subject to, and conditional upon, the\nsatisfaction or waiver of certain conditions, including, among other things, (i) the registration\nstatement on Form\nS-4 of which this prospectus forms a part having been declared effective by the SEC on or prior to the\nExpiration Time and remaining effective on the Settlement Date; (ii) the condition that, as of the\nPricing Time, the combination of the yield of the New Notes and the Total Exchange Consideration for the\napplicable series of Existing Notes would result in the New Notes and such Existing Notes not being\ntreated as \x93substantially\ndifferent\x94 under FASB Accounting Standards Codification (\x93ASC\x94) 470-50 (the \x93Accounting Treatment\nCondition\x94); (iii) the requirement, with respect to the Exchange Offers of New Notes\nfor Existing Notes, that we issue at least (a) $3,000,000,000 aggregate principal amount of New 2052\nNotes and (b) $750,000,000 aggregate principal amount of New 2062 Notes; (iv) the Yield Condition (as\ndefined below) (for any applicable series\nof Existing Notes); and (v) that nothing has occurred or may occur that would or might, in our reasonable\njudgment, be expected to prohibit, prevent, restrict or delay an Exchange Offer or delay the scheduled\nPricing Time or impair us from\nrealizing the anticipated benefits of an Exchange Offer. The Exchange Offer for any particular series of\nExisting Notes is further subject to the condition that the acceptance of validly tendered series of\nExisting Notes with a higher acceptance\npriority level would not result in the issuance of New 2052 Notes or New 2062 Notes in excess of the New\n2052 Notes Issue Cap or the New 2062 Notes Issue Cap, as applicable. We may, at our option, waive any\nsuch conditions at or by the Expiration\nTime, except the condition that the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part has been\ndeclared effective by the SEC on or prior to the Expiration Time and remains effective on the Settlement\nDate. The \x93Settlement Date\x94\nwill promptly follow the Expiration Time and is expected to be March 17, 2021, which is the second\nbusiness day following the Expiration Time. Tendering holders of Existing Notes must tender Existing\nNotes in minimum denominations of $2,000 and\nintegral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof. New Notes will be issued in minimum denominations of\n$2,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof.\n\nIn our sole discretion and subject to applicable law, we reserve the right to remove one or more series\nof Existing Notes from the Exchange Offers if we\ndetermine that the Accounting Treatment Condition or the Yield Condition for such series of Existing\nNotes will not be achieved. Any such decision will be determined as of the Pricing Time and would be\nannounced with the pricing terms. In the event\nwe remove a particular series of Existing Notes from an Exchange Offer, the acceptance priority level for\nany series of Existing Notes below such series of notes removed will be adjusted accordingly.\n\ni\n\nThe Yield Condition Notwithstanding any other provision in this prospectus to the contrary, if, at the\nPricing Time, the yield of the 30-yearReference UST Security with respect to any series of Existing Notes\n(as set forth in the table below) is less than the applicable minimum yield or is greater than the\napplicable maximum yield with respect to such series of Existing Notes, then, unless this condition is\nwaived by us, we will not accept for exchange, or issue the applicable series of New Notes in exchange\nfor, any Existing Notes of such series tendered in the Exchange Offers (the \x93Yield Condition\x94).\n                                                                                           \n  Title of Security                                                                        \n  Pool 1 Notes             Reference UST Security          Minimum\xa0Yield    Maximum\xa0Yield  \n  4.875% Notes due 2043    1.625% due November\xa015, 2050    1.00%            2.40%          \n ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── \n  4.450% Notes due 2045    1.625% due November\xa015, 2050    1.00%            2.40%          \n  4.250% Notes due 2047    1.625% due November\xa015, 2050    1.00%            2.40%          \n  5.300% Notes due 2041    1.625% due November\xa015, 2050    1.00%            2.40%          \n  5.200% Notes due 2039    1.625% due November\xa015, 2050    1.00%            2.40%          \n  4.500% Notes due 2040    1.625% due November\xa015, 2050    1.00%            2.40%          \n  3.700% Notes due 2046    1.625% due November\xa015, 2050    1.00%            2.40%          \n  3.750% Notes due 2043    1.625% due November\xa015, 2050    1.00%            2.40%          \n  3.750% Notes due 2045    1.625% due November\xa015, 2050    1.00%            2.40%          \n  3.500% Notes due 2042    1.625% due November\xa015, 2050    1.00%            2.40%          \n  4.100% Notes due 2037    1.625% due November\xa015, 2050    1.00%            2.40%          \n  4.200% Notes due 2035    1.625% due November\xa015, 2050    1.00%            2.40%          \n  3.450% Notes due 2036    1.625% due November\xa015, 2050    1.00%            2.40%          \n  3.500% Notes due 2035    1.625% due November\xa015, 2050    1.00%            2.40%          \n  Pool 2 Notes                                                                             \n  3.950% Notes due 2056    1.625% due November\xa015, 2050    1.00%            2.40%          \n  4.750% Notes due 2055    1.625% due November\xa015, 2050    1.00%            2.40%          \n  4.500% Notes due 2057    1.625% due November\xa015, 2050    1.00%            2.40%          \n  4.000% Notes due 2055    1.625% due November\xa015, 2050    1.00%            2.40%          \n                                                                                           \nTotal Exchange Consideration and Exchange Consideration Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set\nforth in this prospectus: If you validly tender Existing Notes prior to the Early Exchange Time and do\nnot validly withdraw such tendered Existing Notes prior to the Expiration Time, and such Existing Notes\nare accepted by us, you will receive, for each $1,000 principal amount of Existing Notes tendered and\naccepted, a combination of a principal amount of New Notes and cash with an aggregate value equal to the\nTotal Exchange Consideration as follows:\n                                                                                                         \n       an aggregate principal amount of New Notes equal to (a)\xa0the Total Exchange Consideration for      \n  (i)  such Existing Notes                                                                               \n       minus (b)\xa0the Cash Component (as defined below); and                                              \n                                                                                                         \n                                                     \n  (ii)  a cash payment equal to the Cash Component.  \n                                                     \nii\n\nIf you validly tender Existing Notes after the Early Exchange Time, but prior to the Expiration Time, and\nsuch Existing Notes are accepted by us, you will receive, for each $1,000 principal amount of Existing\nNotes tendered and accepted, a combination of a principal amount of New Notes and cash with an aggregate\nvalue equal to the Exchange Consideration as follows:\n                                                                                                         \n       an aggregate principal amount of New Notes equal to (a)\xa0the Total Exchange Consideration for      \n  (i)  such Existing Notes                                                                               \n       minus (b)\xa0the Cash Component minus (c)\xa0the Early Exchange Premium; and                            \n                                                                                                         \n                                                     \n  (ii)  a cash payment equal to the Cash Component.  \n                                                     \nThe Total Exchange Consideration and Exchange Consideration may be adjusted as described below. In\naddition to the Total Exchange Consideration or Exchange Consideration, as applicable, holders with\nExisting Notes that are accepted for exchange will receive a cash payment representing (i) all or a\nportion of the accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the Settlement Date and (ii) amounts\ndue in lieu of any fractional amounts of New Notes, in each case, as described herein. As DTC (as defined\nbelow) is the record holder of the Existing Notes, all holders of any Existing Notes will also receive\nany applicable accrued and unpaid interest on those Existing Notes in accordance with DTC procedures,\nregardless of the record dates with respect to each series of Existing Notes. The \x93Pricing Time\x94 will be\n10:00 a.m., New York City time, on March 2, 2021, unless the Early Exchange Time is extended, in which\ncase a new Pricing Time may be established with respect to the Exchange Offers. In the event that the\nEarly Exchange Time is not extended, the Pricing Time will remain the same. The \x93Total Exchange\nConsideration\x94 (calculated at the Pricing Time and in accordance with the formula set forth in Annex A to\nthis prospectus, as illustrated by the hypothetical pricing example included in Annex B to this\nprospectus) for the Existing Notes validly tendered prior to the Early Exchange Time, and not validly\nwithdrawn prior to the Expiration Time, is equal to the discounted value on the Settlement Date of the\nremaining payments of principal and interest per $1,000 principal amount of the Existing Notes through\nthe applicable maturity date or par call date (as applicable) of the Existing Notes, using a yield (the\n\x93Exchange Offer Yield\x94) equal to the sum of: (i) the bid-sideyield on the 30-yearReference UST Security\nset forth with respect to each series of Existing Notes on the front cover of this prospectus plus (ii)\nthe applicable fixed spread set forth with respect to each series of Existing Notes on the front cover of\nthis prospectus, minus accrued and unpaid interest on such series of Existing Notes to but not including\nthe Settlement Date. For the avoidance of doubt, the $30 per $1,000 Early Exchange Premium is included\nwithin the Total Exchange Consideration, as calculated using the Fixed Spread over the 30-yearReference\nUST Security as described herein, and is not in addition to the Total Exchange Consideration. Further,\nfor the avoidance of doubt, for the Existing Notes that have par call dates, if the applicable Exchange\nOffer Yield as determined in accordance with this prospectus is less than the contractual annual rate of\ninterest, then such Total Consideration will be calculated based on the par call date; if the applicable\nExchange Offer Yield as determined in accordance with this prospectus is higher than or equal to the\ncontractual annual rate of interest, then such Total Consideration will be calculated based on the\nmaturity date. The \x93Cash Component\x94 is the portion of the Total Exchange Consideration to be paid to\nholders in cash and is equal to (i) the applicable Cash Payment Percent of Premium for such series of\nExisting Notes multiplied by (ii) (a) the applicable Total Exchange Consideration for such series of\nExisting Notes minus (b) $1,000. iii\n\nThe \x93Cash Payment Percent of Premium\x94 is the percent (as set forth with respect to each\nseries of Existing Notes on the front cover of this prospectus) of the amount by which the Total Exchange\nConsideration (as calculated at the Pricing Time and in accordance with the formula set forth in Annex A\nto this prospectus, as illustrated by\nthe hypothetical pricing example included in Annex B to this prospectus) exceeds $1,000 per $1,000\nprincipal amount of such Existing Notes.\n\nThe\n\x93Exchange Consideration\x94 for the Existing Notes validly tendered after the Early Exchange Time but prior\nto the Expiration Time is equal to the Total Exchange Consideration minus the applicable Early Exchange\nPremium.\n\nSee \x93Description of the Exchange Offers\x97Total Exchange Consideration and Exchange Consideration.\x94\n\nEarly Exchange Premium\n\nTo encourage holders of Existing\nNotes to tender prior to the Early Exchange Time, the Total Exchange Consideration includes an Early\nExchange Premium of $30 principal amount of New 2052 Notes or $30 principal amount of New 2062 Notes, as\napplicable, for each $1,000 principal\namount of Existing Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn (the \x93Early Exchange Premium\x94). Only\nholders who validly tender their Existing Notes prior to the Early Exchange Time (and who do not validly\nwithdraw prior to the\nExpiration Time), and whose tenders are accepted for exchange pursuant to the Exchange Offers, will\nreceive the Early Exchange Premium.\n\nUpon the\nterms and subject to the conditions set forth in this prospectus, holders who validly tender their\nExisting Notes after the Early Exchange Time but prior to the Expiration Time, and whose tenders are\naccepted for exchange by us, will receive only\nthe Exchange Consideration, which does not include the Early Exchange Premium.\n\nThe \x93Early Exchange Time\x94 is 5:00 p.m., New York City\ntime, on March 1, 2021, unless extended, in which case the Early Exchange Time will be such time and date\nto which the Early Exchange Time is extended. The \x93Expiration Time\x94 is 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on\nMarch 15, 2021, unless\nextended, in which case the Expiration Time will be such time and date to which the Expiration Time is\nextended.\n\nSee \x93Description of the\nExchange Offers\x97Total Exchange Consideration and Exchange Consideration\x97Early Exchange Premium.\x94\n\nAdjustment of the Total Exchange Consideration and Exchange Consideration\n\nWe may, at our option, elect to increase or decrease the principal amount of (i) New 2052 Notes\nexchangeable for\neach $1,000 principal amount of the applicable Pool 1 Notes tendered and accepted by up to $100 per\n$1,000 principal amount and (ii) New 2062 Notes exchangeable for each $1,000 principal amount of the\napplicable Pool 2 Notes tendered and\naccepted by up to $100 per $1,000 principal amount. Such adjustments would affect the composition, but\nnot the amount, of the Total Exchange Consideration and the Exchange Consideration for the applicable\nExisting Notes. We expect any such election\nto be made as of the Pricing Time, which is scheduled to be the 10th business day prior to the Expiration\nTime.\n\niv\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n                                                                            \n                                                                      Page  \n  About this Prospectus                                                  v  \n  Incorporation of Certain Information by Reference                      v  \n  Forward-Looking Statements                                            vi  \n  Prospectus Summary                                                     1  \n  Risk Factors                                                          13  \n  Use of Proceeds                                                       16  \n  Description of the Exchange Offers                                    17  \n  Description of the New Notes                                          33  \n  Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations                        45  \n  Notices to Certain Non-U.S.                                           55  \n  Holders                                                                   \n  Validity of the New Notes                                             59  \n  Experts                                                               59  \n  Where You Can Find More Information                                   60  \n  Annex A\x97Formula to Determine the Total Exchange Consideration and     A-1  \n  Exchange\xa0Consideration                                                    \n  Annex B\x97Hypothetical Calculation of Total Exchange                    B-1  \n  Consideration and Exchange Consideration                                  \n                                                                            \nABOUT THIS PROSPECTUS As used in this prospectus, unless otherwise stated or the context otherwise\nrequires, \x93we,\x94 \x93us,\x94 the \x93Company,\x94 \x93our,\x94 or \x93Microsoft\x94 means Microsoft Corporation and its\nconsolidated subsidiaries.

See \x93Where You Can Find More Information\x94 in this\nprospectus. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only risks facing us and your\ninvestment in the New Notes. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of, or those we\ncurrently deem less significant, also may become important factors that affect us. The following risks\ncould materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or\nliquidity. The value of the New Notes could decline due to any of these risks, and you may lose all or\npart of your investment.\n\nRisks Related to the Exchange Offers\n\nThe liquidity of the Existing Notes that are not exchanged will be reduced.\n\nWe expect that the trading market for unexchanged Existing Notes will become more limited than the\nexisting trading market and could cease to exist\naltogether due to the reduction in the amount of the Existing Notes outstanding upon consummation of the\nExchange Offers. Because of the acceptance priority levels, it is more likely that a reduction in the\nprincipal amount outstanding could occur\nwith respect to a series of Existing Notes having a higher priority acceptance level. A more limited\ntrading market for a particular series of Existing Notes might adversely affect the liquidity, market\nprice and price volatility of such series of\nExisting Notes. If a market for unexchanged Existing Notes exists or develops, those securities may trade\nat a discount to the price at which the securities would trade if the amount outstanding were not\nreduced, depending on prevailing interest\nrates, the market for similar securities and other factors. However, we cannot assure you that an active\nmarket in the unexchanged Existing Notes will exist, develop or be maintained or as to the prices at\nwhich the unexchanged Existing Notes may be\ntraded.\n\nWe have not made a recommendation as to whether you should tender your Existing Notes in exchange for the\nNew Notes in the Exchange Offers, and we have not made a determination or obtained a third-party\ndetermination that the Exchange Offers are fair to holders of the Existing Notes.\n\nNeither we nor our board of directors has made, nor will either make, any recommendation as to whether\nholders of Existing Notes should tender their\nExisting Notes in exchange for the New Notes pursuant to the Exchange Offers. Furthermore, neither we nor\nour board of directors has made any determination that the consideration to be received represents a fair\nvaluation of the Existing Notes, and\nwe also have not retained, and do not intend to retain, any unaffiliated representative to act solely on\nbehalf of the holders of Existing Notes for purposes of negotiating the terms of the Exchange Offers, or\npreparing a report or making any\nrecommendation concerning the fairness of the Exchange Offers. Holders of Existing Notes must make their\nown independent decisions regarding their participation in the applicable Exchange Offer.\n\nThe Exchange Offers may be cancelled or delayed.\n\nThe\nconsummation of the Exchange Offers is subject to, and conditional upon, the satisfaction or, where\npermitted, waiver of the conditions specified in this prospectus. See \x93Description of the Exchange\nOffers\x97Conditions to the Exchange\nOffers.\x94 In addition, unless we waive such condition, if less than $3,000,000,000 of New 2052 Notes would\nbe issued, then all Pool 1 Note tenders will be\n\n13\n\ncancelled and no New 2052 Notes will be created; and unless we waive such condition, if less than\n$750,000,000 of New 2062 Notes would be issued, then all Pool 2 Note tenders will be cancelled\nand no New 2062 Notes will be created. Further, each of the Exchange Offers may be canceled in whole or\nwith respect to specific series of Existing Notes, as applicable, if the applicable Yield Condition is\nnot met Even if each of the Exchange\nOffers is completed, the Exchange Offers may not be completed on the schedule described in this\nprospectus. Accordingly, holders participating in the Exchange Offers may have to wait longer than they\nexpect to receive the New Notes.\n\nWe have established priorities for acceptance of the Existing Notes, which makes it more likely that\nholders of series of Existing Notes with a lower acceptance priority may be excluded from acceptance of\ntender. Any tenders that are accepted may be prorated.\n\nIf New Notes in an aggregate principal\namount in excess of the applicable New Issue Cap are to be issued pursuant to validly tendered Existing\nNotes in the applicable Exchange Offer at the Expiration Time, we will accept tenders of Existing Notes\nby series in accordance with the\n\x93acceptance priority level\x94 (in numerical priority order) set forth in the applicable table on the front\ncover of this prospectus. With respect to Existing Notes tendered in an Exchange Offer, and not validly\nwithdrawn prior to the\nExpiration Time, such Existing Notes of a series having a higher acceptance priority level will be\naccepted for exchange before any such Existing Notes of a series having a lower acceptance priority\nlevel.\n\nIf acceptance of all validly tendered Existing Notes of a series would result in us issuing New Notes\nhaving an aggregate principal amount in excess of\nthe applicable New Issue Cap, the tendered Existing Notes of such series will be accepted subject to\nproration. See \x93Description of the Exchange Offers\x97Acceptance Priority Levels and Proration Procedures.\x94\n\nLate deliveries of Existing Notes or any other failure to comply with the Exchange Offer procedures could\nprevent a holder from exchanging its Existing Notes.\n\nHolders of Existing Notes are responsible for complying with all the procedures of the Exchange Offers.\nThe issuance of New Notes in\nexchange for Existing Notes will only occur upon proper completion of the procedures described in this\nprospectus under \x93Description of the Exchange Offers.\x94 Therefore, holders of Existing Notes who wish to\nexchange their Existing Notes\nfor New Notes should allow sufficient time for timely completion of the procedures of the Exchange\nOffers. Neither we nor the Exchange Agent are obligated to extend the Exchange Offers or notify you of\nany failure to follow the proper procedures.\n\nWe may acquire New Notes in future transactions.\n\nWe may in the future seek to acquire New Notes in open market or privately-negotiated transactions,\nthrough subsequent exchange offers or otherwise. The\nterms of any of those purchases or offers could differ from the terms of these Exchange Offers and such\nother terms may be more or less favorable to holders of the New Notes.\n\nRisks Related to the New Notes\n\nThe Indenture governing the New Notes does not contain financial covenants or meaningful restrictions on\nus or our subsidiaries.\n\nNeither we nor any of our subsidiaries are\nrestricted from incurring additional debt or other liabilities, including debt secured by liens, under\nthe Indenture. We may from time to time incur additional debt and other liabilities. In addition, we are\nnot restricted from paying dividends or\nmaking distributions on our capital stock or purchasing or redeeming our capital stock under the\nIndenture.\n\n14\n\nActive trading markets for the New Notes may not develop. The New Notes are new issues of securities with\nno established trading markets. We do not intend to apply for listing of the New Notes on any securities\nexchange. We cannot assure you trading markets for the New Notes will develop or of the ability of\nholders of the New Notes to sell their notes or of the prices at which holders may be able to sell their\nnotes. The Dealer Managers have advised us that they currently intend to make a market in each series of\nthe New Notes. However, the Dealer Managers are not obligated to do so, and any market-making with\nrespect to the New Notes may be discontinued, in their sole discretion, at any time without notice. If no\nactive trading markets develop, you may be unable to resell the New Notes at any price or at their fair\nmarket value. If trading markets do develop, changes in our ratings or the financial markets could\nadversely affect the market prices of the New Notes. The market prices of the New Notes will depend on\nmany factors, including, among others, the following:\n                                                                   \n      ratings on our debt securities assigned by rating agencies;  \n                                                                   \n                                                                                  \n      the prevailing interest rates being paid by other companies similar to us;  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                         \n      our results of operations, financial condition and prospects; and  \n                                                                         \n                                               \n      the condition of the financial markets.  \n                                               \nThe condition of the financial markets and prevailing interest rates have fluctuated in the past and are\nlikely to fluctuate in the future, which could have an adverse effect on the market prices of the New\nNotes. Rating agencies continually review the ratings they have assigned to companies and debt\nsecurities. Negative changes in the ratings assigned to us or our debt securities could have an adverse\neffect on the market prices of the New Notes. 15\n\nUSE OF PROCEEDS\n\nWe will not receive any cash proceeds from the issuance of the New Notes in the Exchange Offers. The\nExisting Notes that are surrendered in exchange for\nthe New Notes will be retired and cancelled and cannot be reissued.\n\n16\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE EXCHANGE OFFERS Terms of the Exchange Offers We are offering to holders, upon the\nterms and subject to the conditions set forth in this prospectus, consideration consisting of up to\n$6,250,000,000 aggregate principal amount of our New 2052 Notes (the \x93New 2052 Notes Issue Cap\x94) and a\ncash payment, and up to $1,250,000,000 aggregate principal amount of our New 2062 Notes (the \x93New 2062\nNotes Issue Cap\x94 and, together with the New 2052 Notes Issue Cap, the \x93New Issue Cap\x94) and a cash\npayment, as applicable, in exchange for their Existing Notes, all as described under \x93\x97Total Exchange\nConsideration and Exchange Consideration.\x94 Holders of each series of Existing Notes accepted for exchange\nwill be eligible to receive the applicable Total Exchange Consideration as determined as described under\n\x93\x97Total Exchange Consideration and Exchange Consideration\x94 for such series of Existing Notes validly\ntendered on or before the Early Exchange Time and not validly withdrawn.

We will accept valid tenders of Existing Notes by series in accordance with the\nacceptance priority levels (in numerical priority order) set forth in the applicable table on the front\ncover of this prospectus, subject to proration as discussed under \x93\x97Acceptance Priority Levels and\nProration Procedures.\x94 Total Exchange Consideration and Exchange Consideration Upon the terms and subject\nto the conditions set forth in this prospectus: If you validly tender Existing Notes prior to the Early\nExchange Time and do not validly withdraw such tendered Existing Notes prior to the Expiration Time, and\nsuch Existing Notes are accepted by us, you will receive, for each $1,000 principal amount of Existing\nNotes tendered and accepted, a combination of a principal amount of New Notes and cash with an aggregate\nvalue equal to the Total Exchange Consideration as follows:\n                                                                                                         \n       an aggregate principal amount of New Notes equal to (a)\xa0the Total Exchange Consideration for      \n  (i)  such Existing Notes                                                                               \n       minus (b)\xa0the Cash Component; and                                                                 \n                                                                                                         \n                                                     \n  (ii)  a cash payment equal to the Cash Component.  \n                                                     \nIf you validly tender Existing Notes after the Early Exchange Time, but prior to the Expiration Time, and\nsuch Existing Notes are accepted by us, you will receive, for each $1,000 principal amount of Existing\nNotes tendered and accepted, a combination of a principal amount 17\n\nof New Notes and cash with an aggregate value equal to the Exchange Consideration as follows:\n                                                                                                         \n       an aggregate principal amount of New Notes equal to (a)\xa0the Total Exchange Consideration for      \n  (i)  such Existing Notes                                                                               \n       minus (b)\xa0the Cash Component minus (c)\xa0the Early Exchange Premium; and                            \n                                                                                                         \n                                                     \n  (ii)  a cash payment equal to the Cash Component.  \n                                                     \nThe Total Exchange Consideration and Exchange Consideration may be adjusted as described under\n\x93\x97Adjustment of the Total Exchange Consideration and Exchange Consideration.\x94 In addition to the Total\nExchange Consideration or Exchange Consideration, as applicable, holders with Existing Notes that are\naccepted for exchange will receive a cash payment representing (i) all or a portion of the accrued and\nunpaid interest to, but not including, the Settlement Date, and (ii) amounts due in lieu of any\nfractional amounts of New Notes, in each case, as described under \x93\x97Accrued Interest\x94 and \x93\x97No Fractional\nAmounts of New Notes.\x94 As DTC is the record holder of the Existing Notes, all holders of any Existing\nNotes will also receive any applicable accrued and unpaid interest on those Existing Notes in accordance\nwith DTC procedures, regardless of the record dates with respect to each series of Existing Notes. The\n\x93Pricing Time\x94 will be 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on March 2, 2021, unless the Early Exchange Time\nis extended, in which case a new Pricing Time may be established with respect to the Exchange Offers. In\nthe event that the Early Exchange Time is not extended, the Pricing Time will remain the same. The \x93Total\nExchange Consideration\x94 (calculated at the Pricing Time and in accordance with the formula set forth in\nAnnex A to this prospectus, as illustrated by the hypothetical pricing example included in Annex B to\nthis prospectus) for the Existing Notes validly tendered prior to the Early Exchange Time, and not\nvalidly withdrawn prior to the Expiration Time, is equal to the discounted value on the Settlement Date\nof the remaining payments of principal and interest per $1,000 principal amount of the Existing Notes\nthrough the applicable maturity date or par call date (as applicable) of the Existing Notes, using a\nyield equal to the sum of: (i) the bid-sideyield on the 30-yearReference UST Security set forth with\nrespect to each series of Existing Notes on the front cover of this prospectus plus (ii) the applicable\nfixed spread set forth with respect to each series of Existing Notes on the front cover of this\nprospectus, minus accrued and unpaid interest on such series of Existing Notes up to but not including\nthe Settlement Date. For the avoidance of doubt, the $30 per $1,000 Early Exchange Premium is included\nwithin the Total Exchange Consideration, as calculated using the Fixed Spread over the 30-yearReference\nUST Security as described herein, and is not in addition to the Total Exchange Consideration. Further,\nfor the avoidance of doubt, for the Existing Notes that have par call dates, if the applicable Exchange\nOffer Yield as determined in accordance with this prospectus is less than the contractual annual rate of\ninterest, then such Total Consideration will be calculated based on the par call date; if the applicable\nExchange Offer Yield as determined in accordance with this prospectus is higher than or equal to the\ncontractual annual rate of interest, then such Total Consideration will be calculated based on the\nmaturity date. The \x93Exchange Consideration\x94 for the Existing Notes validly tendered after the Early\nExchange Time but prior to the Expiration Time is equal to the Total Exchange Consideration minus the\napplicable Early Exchange Premium. The \x93Cash Component\x94 is the portion of the Total Exchange\nConsideration to be paid to holders in cash and is equal to (i) the applicable Cash Payment Percent of\nPremium for such series of Existing Notes multiplied by (ii) (a) the applicable Total Exchange\nConsideration for such series of Existing Notes minus (b) $1,000. 18\n\nThe Dealer Managers will calculate the interest rate of the New Notes, the Total Exchange\nConsideration, the Exchange Consideration, the Cash Component and accrued interest for each of the\nExisting Notes, and their calculations will be final and binding absent manifest error, subject to\nholders of Existing Notes disputing such\ndetermination in a court of competent jurisdiction. We will announce the interest rate of the New Notes,\nthe Total Exchange Consideration, the Exchange Consideration and the Cash Component for the Existing\nNotes promptly after they are determined by\nthe Dealer Managers. The formula that will be used by the Dealer Managers in making the calculations of\nthe Total Exchange Consideration and the Exchange Consideration is attached hereto as Annex A. A\nhypothetical pricing example for the calculation\nof the Total Exchange Consideration and the Exchange Consideration is set forth in Annex B attached\nhereto.\n\nYou can obtain recently calculated\nhypothetical quotes of the yield for the 30-year Reference UST Security set forth with respect to each\nseries of Existing Notes on the front cover of this prospectus, the hypothetical interest rate of the New\nNotes, the hypothetical Total Exchange Consideration and the hypothetical Exchange Consideration for the\nExisting Notes prior to the Pricing Time, and can obtain the actual yield for the 30-year Reference UST\nSecurity set forth with respect to each series of Existing Notes on the front cover of this prospectus,\nthe interest rate of the New Notes, the Total Exchange Consideration and the Exchange Consideration for\nthe Existing Notes after the Pricing\nTime, by contacting the Dealer Managers at the addresses and telephone numbers set forth on the back\ncover of this prospectus. Although the Dealer Managers will calculate the Total Exchange Consideration\nand the Exchange Consideration for the\nExisting Notes based solely on the yield on the 30-year Reference UST Security set forth with respect to\neach series of Existing Notes on the front cover of this prospectus, you can also find information\nregarding the closing yield to maturity for each 30-year Reference UST Security on any trading day in the\nonline versions of The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times.\n\nEarly Exchange Premium\n\nTo encourage holders of Existing\nNotes to tender prior to the Early Exchange Time, the Total Exchange Consideration includes an Early\nExchange Premium of $30 principal amount of New 2052 Notes or $30 principal amount of New 2062 Notes, as\napplicable, for each $1,000 principal\namount of Existing Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn. Only holders who validly tender\ntheir Existing Notes prior to the Early Exchange Time (and who do not validly withdraw prior to the\nExpiration Time), and whose tenders are accepted\nfor exchange pursuant to the Exchange Offers, will receive the Early Exchange Premium.\n\nHolders who validly tender their Existing Notes after the\nEarly Exchange Time but prior to the Expiration Time, and whose tenders are accepted for exchange, will\nreceive only the Exchange Consideration, which does not include the Early Exchange Premium.\n\nAdjustment of the Total Exchange Consideration and Exchange Consideration\n\nWe may, at our option, elect to increase or decrease the principal amount of (i) New 2052 Notes\nexchangeable for each $1,000 principal amount of the\napplicable Pool 1 Notes tendered and accepted by up to $100 per $1,000 principal amount and (ii) New 2062\nNotes exchangeable for each $1,000 principal amount of the applicable Pool 2 Notes tendered and accepted\nby up to $100 per $1,000\nprincipal amount. Such adjustments would affect the composition, but not the amount, of the Total\nExchange Consideration and the Exchange Consideration for the applicable Existing Notes. We expect any\nsuch election to be made as of the Pricing Time,\nwhich is scheduled to be the 10th business day prior to the Expiration Time.\n\n19\n\nAccrued Interest\n\nIn addition to the Total Exchange Consideration or the Exchange Consideration, as applicable, we will pay\nall of the accrued and unpaid interest to, but\nnot including, the Settlement Date on Existing Notes which are validly tendered and accepted. As DTC is\nthe record holder of the Existing Notes, all holders of any Existing Notes will also receive any\napplicable accrued and unpaid interest on those\nExisting Notes in accordance with DTC procedures, regardless of the record dates with respect to each\nseries of Existing Notes.\n\nNo Fractional Amounts of New Notes\n\nNew Notes will be issued in minimum denominations of $2,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess\nthereof. We will not accept any\ntender that would result in the issuance of less than $2,000 principal amount of New Notes. If, under the\nterms of the Exchange Offers, the aggregate principal amount of New Notes that any tendering holder is\nentitled to receive is not in a minimum\ndenomination of $2,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof, we will round downward the\namount of the New Notes to $1,000 or the nearest integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof and pay\nthe difference in cash.\n\nAcceptance Priority Levels and Proration Procedures\n\nWe will\naccept tenders of Existing Notes by series in accordance with the \x93acceptance priority level\x94 (in\nnumerical priority order) for each such series as set forth in the applicable table on the front cover of\nthis prospectus. With respect to\nExisting Notes tendered in an Exchange Offer, such Existing Notes of a series having a higher acceptance\npriority level for such Exchange Offer will be accepted for exchange before any such Existing Notes of a\nseries having a lower acceptance\npriority level.\n\nIf acceptance of all validly tendered Existing Notes of a series would result in us issuing New Notes\nhaving an aggregate principal\namount in excess of the applicable New Issue Cap, the tendered Existing Notes of such series will be\naccepted subject to proration.\n\nAny proration\nwould result in the principal amount of Existing Notes of the applicable series accepted from a holder of\nExisting Notes in exchange for New Notes to be equal to the applicable principal amount of Existing Notes\nthat would otherwise have been\naccepted from such holder (based on such holder\x92s valid tenders of the applicable series of Existing\nNotes) multiplied by the proration factor. The proration factor would be equal to the amount of the\napplicable New Issue Cap remaining\navailable for the applicable series of Existing Notes divided by the total aggregate principal amount of\nExisting Notes of the applicable series that were validly tendered. Depending on the aggregate principal\namount of Existing Notes of the\napplicable series validly tendered and not validly withdrawn and the proration factor applied, if the\nprincipal amount of Existing Notes of such series returned to a holder as a result of proration would\nresult in less than $2,000 of principal\namount of Existing Notes of such series being returned to such holder, the Company will either accept or\nreject all of such holder\x92s Existing Notes of such series validly tendered and not validly withdrawn. The\nproration factor will be\nannounced by press release as promptly as practicable after the Expiration Time. Existing Notes not\naccepted due to their acceptance priority level or the above proration procedures will be returned to\ntheir tendering holders promptly after the\nExpiration Time.\n\nExpiration Time; Extensions; Amendments; Termination\n\nFor purposes of the Exchange Offers, the term \x93Expiration Time\x94 means 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on\nMarch 15, 2021, subject to our right\nto extend that time and date in our absolute discretion, in which case the Expiration Time means the\nlatest time and date to which an Exchange Offer is extended.\n\n20\n\nWe reserve the right, in our absolute discretion, by giving oral or written notice to the Exchange Agent,\nto:\n                                 \n      extend an Exchange Offer;  \n                                 \n                                    \n      amend an Exchange Offer; and  \n                                    \n                                                                                                         \n      terminate an Exchange Offer in those situations in which a condition to our obligation to          \n      exchange the series of Existing                                                                    \n      Notes subject to such Exchange Offer for New Notes and cash is not satisfied or waived on or       \n      before the Expiration Time.                                                                        \n                                                                                                         \nIf an Exchange Offer is amended in a manner that we determine constitutes a material change, we will\nextend such Exchange Offer for a period of two to ten business days, depending upon the significance of\nthe amendment and the manner of disclosure to the holders, if such Exchange Offer would otherwise have\nexpired during that two-to-tenbusiness day period. If any Exchange Offer is extended with respect to any\nseries of Existing Notes, we will also extend any Exchange Offers for all series having a lower\nacceptance priority level to such \x93new\x94 Expiration Time. Any increase in the consideration offered to\nholders of a series of Existing Notes pursuant to the Exchange Offers will be paid to all holders whose\nExisting Notes of such series have been previously tendered and not validly withdrawn. In addition, if we\nextend the Early Exchange Time, we may in our discretion extend it with respect to only one or more\nExchange Offers or series of Existing Notes and not all. We will promptly announce any extension,\namendment or termination of an Exchange Offer by issuing a press release. We will announce any extension\nof the Pricing Time and/or Expiration Time no later than 9:00 a.m., New York City time, on the first\nbusiness day after the previously scheduled Pricing Time and/or Expiration Time, as applicable. We have\nno other obligation to publish, advertise or otherwise communicate any information about any extension,\namendment or termination. Settlement Date We will deliver the New Notes and pay cash amounts with respect\nto the Exchange Offers on the Settlement Date. The \x93Settlement Date\x94 will promptly follow the Expiration\nTime and is expected to be March 17, 2021, which is the second business day following the Expiration\nTime. We will not be obligated to deliver New Notes or pay any cash amounts unless the Exchange Offers\nare consummated. Conditions to the Exchange Offers Notwithstanding any other provisions of the Exchange\nOffers, or any extension of the Exchange Offers, we will not be required to accept any Existing Notes for\nexchange, exchange any New Notes for Existing Notes or pay any cash amounts, and we may terminate any\nExchange Offer or, at our option, modify, extend or otherwise amend an Exchange Offer if any of the\nfollowing conditions have not been satisfied or waived on or before the Expiration Time (unless stated\notherwise): 1. the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part having been declared\neffective by the SEC on or prior to the Expiration Time and remaining effective on the Settlement Date;\n2. as of the Pricing Time, the combination of the yield of the New Notes and the Total Exchange\nConsideration or Exchange Consideration for the applicable series of Existing Notes would result in the\nNew Notes and such Existing Notes not being treated as \x93substantially different\x94 under ASC 470-50(the\n\x93Accounting Treatment Condition\x94); 21\n\n3. we issue at least (a) $3,000,000,000 aggregate principal amount of New 2052\nNotes and (b) $750,000,000 aggregate principal amount of New 2062 Notes;\n\n4. the Yield Condition (for any applicable series\nof Existing Notes);\n\n5. no action or event shall have occurred, been threatened, no action shall have been taken, and no\nstatute, rule, regulation, judgment, order, stay, decree, injunction or regulatory comments shall have\nbeen issued, promulgated, enacted, entered, enforced or deemed to be applicable to such Exchange Offer or\nthe exchange of Existing Notes for New\nNotes under such Exchange Offer by or before any court or governmental regulatory or administrative\nagency, authority, instrumentality or tribunal, including, without limitation, taxing authorities, that\neither:\n\n(a) challenges the making of such Exchange Offer or the exchange of Existing Notes for New Notes and cash\nunder\nsuch Exchange Offer or might, directly or indirectly, be reasonably expected to prohibit, prevent,\nrestrict or delay the scheduled Pricing Time or the consummation of, or might otherwise adversely affect\nin any manner, such Pricing Time, Exchange\nOffer or the exchange of Existing Notes for New Notes and cash under such Exchange Offer; or\n\n(b) in our\nreasonable judgment, could materially adversely affect our (or our subsidiaries\x92) business, condition\n(financial or otherwise), income, operations, properties, assets, liabilities or prospects or impair the\ncontemplated benefits to us of such\nExchange Offer, the exchange of Existing Notes for New Notes under such Exchange Offer or the delivery of\nany cash amounts;\n\n6. nothing has occurred or may occur that would or might, in our reasonable judgment, be expected to\nprohibit, prevent, restrict\nor delay such Exchange Offer or delay the schedule Pricing Time or impair our ability to realize the\nanticipated benefits of such Exchange Offer;\n\n7. there shall not have occurred (a) any general suspension of or limitation on trading in securities in\nthe United States\nsecurities or financial markets, whether or not mandatory, (b) any material adverse change in the prices\nof the Existing Notes, (c) a material impairment in the general trading market for debt securities, (d) a\ndeclaration of a\nbanking moratorium or any suspension of payments in respect of banks by federal or state authorities in\nthe United States, whether or not mandatory, (e) a material escalation or commencement of a war, armed\nhostilities, a terrorist act or other\nnational or international calamity directly or indirectly relating to the United States, if the effect of\nany such event, in the Company\x92s reasonable judgment, makes it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed\nwith such Exchange Offer,\n(f) any limitation, whether or not mandatory, by any governmental authority on, or other event in the\nCompany\x92s reasonable judgment, having a reasonable likelihood of affecting, the extension of credit by\nbanks or other lending\ninstitutions in the United States, (g) any material adverse change in the securities or financial markets\nin the United States generally or (h) in the case of any of the foregoing existing at the time of the\ncommencement of the Exchange\nOffers, a material acceleration or worsening thereof;

In our sole discretion and subject to\napplicable law, we reserve the right to remove one or more series of Existing Notes from the Exchange\nOffers if we determine that the Accounting Treatment Condition or the Yield Condition for such series of\nExisting Notes will not be achieved. Any such decision will be determined as of the Pricing Time and\nwould be announced with the pricing terms. In the event we remove a particular series of Existing Notes\nfrom an Exchange Offer, the acceptance priority level for any series of Existing Notes below such series\nof notes removed will be adjusted accordingly. The Yield Condition Notwithstanding any other provision in\nthis prospectus to the contrary, if at the Pricing Time, the yield of the 30-yearReference UST Security,\nas set forth in the table below with respect to any series of Existing Notes, is less than the applicable\nminimum yield or is greater than the applicable maximum yield, to the extent such yield is specified in\nthe table below, then we will not be obligated to accept for exchange, or issue the applicable series of\nNew Notes in exchange for, any Existing Notes of such series tendered in the Exchange Offers.\n

The terms of any such purchases or offers could differ from the\nterms of the Exchange Offers. Any purchase or offer to purchase will be made in accordance with\napplicable law. Certain Consequences to Holders of Existing Notes Not Tendering in the Exchange Offers\nThe following considerations, in addition to the other information described elsewhere herein or\nincorporated by reference herein, should be carefully considered by each holder of Existing Notes before\ndeciding whether to tender Existing Notes pursuant to the Exchange Offers. Limited Trading Market\nConsummation of an Exchange Offer may have adverse consequences to holders of Existing Notes that are\nsubject to such Exchange Offer who elect not to tender their Existing Notes in such Exchange Offer. In\nparticular, the trading market for such Existing Notes that are not exchanged could become more limited\nthan the existing trading market for such Existing Notes and could cease to exist altogether due to the\nreduction in the amount of such Existing Notes outstanding upon consummation of such Exchange Offer.\nBecause of the acceptance priority levels, it is more likely that a reduction in the principal amount\noutstanding could occur with respect to a series of Existing Notes having a higher priority acceptance\nlevel. A more limited trading market for a particular series of Existing Notes might adversely affect the\nliquidity, market price and price volatility of such series of Existing Notes. Treatment of Existing\nNotes Not Tendered in the Exchange Offers Existing Notes not tendered and purchased in the Exchange\nOffers will remain outstanding. The terms and conditions governing the Existing Notes, will remain\nunchanged. No amendments to the indenture governing the Existing Notes are being sought. From time to\ntime in the future, we or our subsidiaries may acquire Existing Notes that are not tendered in the\nExchange Offers through open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, tender offers, exchange\noffers or otherwise, upon such terms and at such prices as we or they may determine, which may be more or\nless than the price to be paid pursuant to the Exchange Offers and could be for cash or other\nconsideration. Alternatively, we may repurchase any or all of the Existing Notes not purchased pursuant\nto the Exchange Offers at any time. We cannot assure you as to which, if any, of these alternatives (or\ncombinations thereof) we or our subsidiaries may choose to pursue in the future. Effect of Tender Any\ntender by a holder, and our subsequent acceptance of that tender, of Existing Notes will constitute a\nbinding agreement between that holder and us upon the terms and subject to the 24\n\nconditions of the applicable Exchange Offer described in this prospectus. The participation in an\nExchange Offer by a tendering holder will constitute the agreement by that holder to deliver good\nand marketable title to the tendered Existing Notes, free and clear of any and all liens, restrictions,\ncharges, pledges, security interests, encumbrances or rights of any kind of third parties.\n\nRepresentations, Warranties and Covenants of Holders of Existing Notes\n\nBy tendering Existing Notes through the submission of an electronic acceptance instruction in accordance\nwith the requirements of ATOP, each holder of\nExisting Notes, or the beneficial holder of Existing Notes on behalf of which the holder has tendered,\nwill, subject to that holder\x92s ability to withdraw its tender, and subject to the terms and conditions of\nthe applicable Exchange Offer\ngenerally, be deemed to represent, warrant, agree and undertake to:\n\n1. irrevocably sell, assign and transfer to or upon our\norder or the order of our nominee all right, title and interest in and to, and any and all claims in\nrespect of or arising or having arisen as a result of the holder\x92s status as a holder of, all Existing\nNotes tendered thereby, such that\nthereafter the holder shall have no contractual or other rights or claims in law or equity against us or\nany fiduciary, trustee, fiscal agent or other person connected with the Existing Notes arising under,\nfrom or in connection with those Existing\nNotes;\n\n2. waive any and all rights with respect to the Existing Notes tendered thereby, including, without\nlimitation, any\nexisting or past defaults and their consequences in respect of those Existing Notes; and\n\n3. release and discharge us and the\ntrustee with respect to the indenture for the Existing Notes from any and all claims that the holder may\nhave, now or in the future, arising out of or related to the Existing Notes tendered thereby, including,\nwithout limitation, any claims that the\nholder is entitled to receive additional principal or interest payments with respect to the Existing\nNotes tendered thereby, other than accrued and unpaid interest on the Existing Notes or as otherwise\nexpressly provided in this prospectus, or to\nparticipate in any redemption or defeasance of the Existing Notes tendered thereby.\n\nIn addition, for each holder of Existing Notes tendered in an\nExchange Offer, the submission of an electronic acceptance instruction in accordance with the\nrequirements of ATOP will be deemed to represent, warrant and agree that:\n\n1. it has received this prospectus;\n\n2. it is the beneficial owner (as defined below) of, or a duly authorized representative of one or more\nbeneficial owners of, the\nExisting Notes tendered thereby, and it has full power and authority to tender, sell, assign and transfer\nthe Existing Notes tendered thereby;\n\n3. the Existing Notes being tendered thereby were owned as of the date of tender, free and clear of any\nliens, charges, claims,\nencumbrances, interests and restrictions of any kind, and we will acquire good, indefeasible and\nunencumbered title to those Existing Notes, free and clear of all liens, charges, claims, encumbrances,\ninterests and restrictions of any kind, when we\naccept the same;\n\n4. it will not sell, pledge, hypothecate or otherwise encumber or transfer any Existing Notes tendered\nthereby from the date of tender, and any purported sale, pledge, hypothecation or other encumbrance or\ntransfer will be void and of no effect;\n\n5. it is not from or located in any jurisdiction where the making or acceptance of the Exchange Offers\ndoes not comply with the\nlaws of that jurisdiction and is otherwise a person to whom it is lawful to make available this\nprospectus or to make the applicable Exchange Offer in accordance with applicable laws;\n\n25\n\n6. it is not resident and/or located in the United Kingdom or, if resident\nand/or located in the United Kingdom, it is: (a) a person falling within the definition of investment\nprofessionals as defined in Article 19(5) of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Financial\nPromotion) Order 2005, as amended (the\n\x93Order\x94); (b) a person falling within Article 43(2) or Articles 49(2)(a) to (d) of the Order; or (c) a\nperson to whom this confidential offering memorandum and other documents or materials relating to the New\nNotes may otherwise\nlawfully be communicated in accordance with the Order;\n\n7. the New Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise\nmade available to and are not being offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in\nthe European Economic Area (the \x93EEA\x94). For these purposes, a \x93retail investor\x94 means a person who is one\n(or more) of:\n(i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of the EU Directive on Markets in Financial\nInstruments (2014/65/EU) (as amended, \x93MiFID II\x94); (ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive (EU)\n2016/97 (the\n\x93Insurance Distribution Directive\x94), where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as\ndefined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in\nRegulation (EU) 2017/1129\n(as amended, the \x93Prospectus Regulation\x94). Consequently, no key information document required by\nRegulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as amended, the \x93PRIIPs Regulation\x94) for offering or selling the New Notes\nor otherwise making them\navailable to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the New\nNotes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful. This\nprospectus has been prepared on the basis that any\noffer of New Notes in any Member State of the EEA will be made pursuant to an exemption under the\nProspectus Regulation from the requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of notes. This prospectus\nis not a prospectus for the purposes of the\nProspectus Regulation;\n\n8. the New Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and are not\nbeing offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the United Kingdom. For these\npurposes, a \x93retail investor\x94 means a person who is one (or more) of (i) a retail client, as defined in\npoint (8) of Article\n2 of Regulation (EU) No 2017/565 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the European Union\n(Withdrawal) Act 2018 (\x93EUWA\x94); or (ii) a customer within the meaning of the provisions of the Financial\nServices and Markets Act 2000\n(as amended, \x93FSMA\x94) and any rules or regulations made under the FSMA to implement the Insurance\nDistribution Directive, where that customer would not qualify as a professional client, as defined in\npoint (8) of Article 2(1) of\nRegulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA; or (iii) not a\nqualified investor as defined in Article 2 of the Prospectus Regulation as it forms part of domestic law\nby virtue of the EUWA (as amended, the\n\x93UK Prospectus Regulation\x94). Consequently no key information document required by the PRIIPs Regulation\nas it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (as amended, the \x93UK PRIIPs Regulation\x94) for\noffering or selling the\nNew Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the UK has been prepared and\ntherefore offering or selling the New Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in\nthe UK may be unlawful under the UK PRIIPs\nRegulation. This prospectus has been prepared on the basis that any offer of New Notes in the UK will be\nmade pursuant to an exemption under the UK Prospectus Regulation from the requirement to publish a\nprospectus for offers of notes.

LLC and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC or their respective\naffiliates, which are primary U.S. government securities dealers in the United States of America and\ntheir respective successors plus two other primary U.S. government securities dealers in the United\nStates of America designated by us; provided, however, that if any of the foregoing ceases to be a\nprimary U.S. government securities dealer in the United States of America (a \x93Primary Treasury Dealer\x94),\nwe will substitute therefor another Primary Treasury Dealer. \x93Reference Treasury Dealer Quotation\x94 means,\nwith respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer and any redemption date, the arithmetic average, as\ndetermined by us, of the bid and asked prices for the applicable Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in\neach case as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to us by such Reference Treasury\nDealer at 3:30 p.m. (New York City time) on the third business day preceding such redemption date.\n\x93Treasury Rate\x94 means, with respect to any redemption date, the rate per annum equal to the semiannual\nequivalent yield to maturity or interpolated maturity (on a day count basis) of the applicable Comparable\nTreasury Issue, assuming a price for such Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its\nprincipal amount) equal to the applicable Comparable Treasury Price for such redemption date. On and\nafter a redemption date, interest will cease to accrue on the New Notes called for redemption or any\nportion of any series of the notes called for redemption (unless we default in the payment of the\nredemption price and accrued and unpaid interest). On or before the redemption date, we will deposit with\nthe trustee money sufficient to pay the redemption price of and (unless the redemption date shall be an\ninterest payment date) accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date on the New Notes of such series\nto be redeemed on such date. If less than all of the New Notes of a series are to be redeemed, the New\nNotes of such series to be redeemed will be selected pursuant to applicable depositary procedures;\nprovided, however, that no New Notes of a principal amount of $2,000 or less shall be redeemed in part.\nCovenants The Indenture sets forth limited covenants, including the covenant described below, that will\napply to each series of New Notes.

As a result, the Successor may exercise our rights and powers under the Indenture, and we will\nbe released from all our liabilities and obligations under the Indenture and under the New Notes. Any\nsubstitution of the Successor for us might be deemed for federal income tax purposes to be an exchange of\nthe New Notes for \x93new\x94 New Notes, resulting in recognition of gain or loss for such purposes and\npossibly certain other adverse tax consequences to beneficial owners of the New Notes. Holders should\nconsult their own tax advisors regarding the tax consequences of any such substitution. For purposes of\nthis covenant, \x93person\x94 means any individual, corporation, partnership, limited liability company, joint\nventure, association, joint-stock company, trust, unincorporated organization or government or any agency\nor political subdivision thereof or any other entity. Events of Default Each of the following events are\ndefined in the Indenture as an \x93event of default\x94 (whatever the reason for such event of default and\nwhether or not it will be voluntary or involuntary or be effected by operation of law or pursuant to any\njudgment, decree or order of any court or any order, rule or regulation of any administrative or\ngovernmental body) with respect to the New Notes: (1) default in the payment of any installment of\ninterest on the New Notes for 30 days after becoming due; (2) default in the payment of principal of or\npremium, if any, on the New Notes when it becomes due and payable at its stated maturity, upon optional\nredemption, upon declaration or otherwise; (3) default in the deposit of any sinking fund payment, when\nand as due by the terms of the New Notes; (4) default in the performance, or breach, of any covenant or\nagreement of ours in the Indenture with respect to the New Notes (other than as referred to in clause\n(1), (2) or (3) above), which 36\n\ncontinues for a period of 90 days after written notice to us by the trustee or to us and the trustee by\nthe holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding New Notes; (5) we pursuant\nto or within the meaning of the Bankruptcy Law:\n                                                \n      commence a voluntary case or proceeding;  \n                                                \n                                                                                                    \n      consent to the entry of an order for relief against us in an involuntary case or proceeding;  \n                                                                                                    \n                                                                                                        \n      consent to the appointment of a Custodian of us or for all or substantially all of our property;  \n                                                                                                        \n                                                                   \n      make a general assignment for the benefit of our creditors;  \n                                                                   \n                                                                                            \n      file a petition in bankruptcy or answer or consent seeking reorganization or relief;  \n                                                                                            \n                                                                                                         \n      consent to the filing of such petition or the appointment of or taking possession by a Custodian;  \n      or                                                                                                 \n                                                                                                         \n                                                                                    \n      take any comparable action under any foreign laws relating to insolvency; or  \n                                                                                    \n(6) a court of competent jurisdiction enters an order or decree under any Bankruptcy Law that:\n                                                                                                 \n      is for relief against us in an involuntary case, or adjudicates us insolvent or bankrupt;  \n                                                                                                 \n                                                                                      \n      appoints a Custodian of us or for all or substantially all of our property; or  \n                                                                                      \n                                                                                          \n      orders the winding-up or liquidation of us (or any similar relief is granted under  \n      any foreign laws);                                                                  \n                                                                                          \nand the order or decree remains unstayed and in effect for 90 days. \x93Bankruptcy Law\x94 means Title 11,\nUnited States Code or any similar federal or state or foreign law for the relief of debtors. \x93Custodian\x94\nmeans any custodian, receiver, trustee, assignee, liquidator or other similar official under any\nBankruptcy Law. If an event of default with respect to the New Notes (other than an event of default\nrelating to certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency, or reorganization of us) occurs and is continuing,\nthe trustee by notice to us, or the holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the\noutstanding New Notes by notice to us and the trustee, may, and the trustee at the request of these\nholders will, declare the principal of and premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest on all the\nNew Notes to be due and payable. Upon such a declaration, such principal, premium and accrued and unpaid\ninterest will be due and payable immediately. If an event of default relating to certain events of\nbankruptcy, insolvency, or reorganization of us occurs and is continuing, the principal of and premium,\nif any, and accrued and unpaid interest on the New Notes will become and be immediately due and payable\nwithout any declaration or other act on the part of the trustee or any holders. The holders of not less\nthan a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding New Notes may rescind a declaration of\nacceleration and its consequences, if we have deposited certain sums with the trustee and all events of\ndefault with respect to the New Notes, other than the non-paymentof the principal or interest which have\nbecome due solely by such acceleration, have been cured or waived, as provided in the Indenture. An event\nof default for a particular series of debt securities does not necessarily constitute an event of default\nfor any other series of debt securities issued under the Indenture. 37\n\nWe are required to furnish the trustee annually a statement by certain of our officers to the effect\nthat, to the best of their knowledge, we are not in default in the fulfillment of any of our obligations\nunder the Indenture or, if there has been a default in the fulfillment of any such obligation, specifying\neach such default. No holder of any debt securities of any series will have any right to institute any\njudicial or other proceeding with respect to the Indenture, or for the appointment of a receiver or\ntrustee, or for any other remedy unless: (1) an event of default has occurred and is continuing and such\nholder has given the trustee prior written notice of such continuing event of default with respect to the\nNew Notes; (2) the holders of not less than 25% of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding New\nNotes have requested the trustee to institute proceedings in respect of such event of default; (3) the\ntrustee has been offered indemnity reasonably satisfactory to it against its costs, expenses and\nliabilities in complying with such request; (4) the trustee has failed to institute proceedings 60 days\nafter the receipt of such notice, request and offer of indemnity; and (5) no direction inconsistent with\nsuch written request has been given for 60 days by the holders of a majority in aggregate principal\namount of the outstanding New Notes. The holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of\noutstanding New Notes will have the right, subject to certain limitations, to direct the time, method and\nplace of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the trustee with respect to the debt\nsecurities of that series or exercising any trust or power conferred to the trustee, and to waive certain\ndefaults. The Indenture provides that if an event of default occurs and is continuing, the trustee will\nexercise such of its rights and powers under the Indenture, and use the same degree of care and skill in\ntheir exercise, as a prudent person would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of such\nperson\x92s own affairs. Subject to such provisions, the trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any\nof its rights or powers under the Indenture at the request of any of the holders of the debt securities\nof a series unless they will have offered to the trustee security or indemnity satisfactory to the\ntrustee against the costs, expenses and liabilities which might be incurred by it in compliance with such\nrequest. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the holder of the New Notes will have an absolute and\nunconditional right to receive payment of the principal of and premium, if any, and interest on the New\nNotes and to institute suit for the enforcement of payment.

The holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal\namount of the outstanding New Notes of a series may, on behalf of the holders of all New Notes of that\nseries, waive any past default and its consequences under the Indenture with respect to that series of\nNew Notes, except a default (1) in the payment of principal or premium, if any, or interest on that\nseries of New Notes or (2) in respect of a covenant or provision of the Indenture that cannot be modified\nor amended without the consent of the holder of each New Note of that series. Upon any such waiver, such\ndefault will cease to exist, and any event of default arising therefrom will be deemed to have been\ncured, for every purpose of the Indenture; however, no such waiver will extend to any subsequent or other\ndefault or event of default or impair any rights consequent thereon. Book-Entry; Delivery and Form;\nGlobal Securities Each series of New Notes will be issued in the form of one or more global securities,\nin definitive, fully registered form without interest coupons, each of which we refer to as a \x93global\nsecurity.\x94 Each such global security will be deposited with the trustee as custodian for DTC and\nregistered in the name of a nominee of DTC in New York, New York for the accounts of participants in DTC.\nWe will not issue certificated securities to you for the New Notes you purchase, except in the limited\ncircumstances described below. Each global security will be issued to DTC, which will keep a computerized\nrecord of its participants whose clients have purchased and beneficially own New Notes of a particular\nseries. Each participant will then keep a record of its clients who have purchased and beneficially own\nNew Notes of a particular series. Unless it is exchanged in whole or in part for a certificated security,\na global security may not be transferred. DTC, its nominee and their successors may, however, transfer a\nglobal security as a whole to one another, and these transfers are required to be recorded on our records\nor a register to be maintained by the trustee. DTC has advised us as follows: DTC is a limited-purpose\ntrust company organized under New York Banking Law, a \x93banking organization\x94 within the meaning of the\nNew York Banking Law, a member of the Federal Reserve System, a \x93clearing corporation\x94 within the meaning\nof the New York Uniform Commercial Code and a \x93clearing agency\x94 registered pursuant to the provisions of\nSection 17A of the Exchange Act. DTC was created to hold securities of institutions that have accounts\nwith DTC (\x93participants\x94) and to facilitate the clearance and settlement of securities transactions among\nits participants in such securities through electronic book-entry changes in accounts of the\nparticipants, thereby eliminating the need for physical movement of securities certificates. DTC\x92s\nparticipants include both U.S. and non-U.S.securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies,\nclearing corporations and certain other organizations. Access to DTC\x92s book-entry system is also\navailable to others such as both U.S. and non-U.S.securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies\nand clearing corporations that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a participant,\nwhether directly or indirectly. Ownership of Beneficial Interests Upon the issuance of each global\nsecurity, DTC will credit, on its book-entry registration and transfer system, the respective principal\namount of the individual beneficial interests represented by the global security to the accounts of\nparticipants. Ownership of beneficial interests in each global security will be limited to participants\nor persons that may hold interests through participants. Beneficial interests in a global security will\nbe shown on, and transfers of beneficial interests in the global 40\n\nsecurities will be made only through, records maintained by DTC and its participants. When you purchase\nnotes through the DTC system, the purchases must be made by or through a direct\nparticipant, which will receive credit for the notes on DTC\x92s records. When you actually purchase the New\nNotes, you will become its beneficial owner. Your ownership interest will be recorded only on the direct\nor indirect participants\x92\nrecords. DTC will have no knowledge of your individual ownership of the notes. DTC\x92s records will show\nonly the identity of the direct participants and the amount of the notes held by or through them. You\nwill not receive a written confirmation\nof your purchase or sale or any periodic account statement directly from DTC. You should instead receive\nthese from your direct or indirect participant. As a result, the direct or indirect participants are\nresponsible for keeping accurate account of\nthe holdings of their customers.\n\nSo long as DTC or its nominee is the registered holder and owner of a global security, DTC or such\nnominee, as the\ncase may be, will be considered the sole legal owner of the New Notes represented by the global security\nfor all purposes under the Indenture, the New Notes and applicable law. Except as set forth below, owners\nof beneficial interests in a global\nsecurity will not be entitled to receive certificated New Notes and will not be considered to be the\nowners or holders of any New Notes represented by the global security. We understand that under existing\nindustry practice, in the event an owner of\na beneficial interest in a global security desires to take any actions that DTC, as the holder of the\nglobal security, is entitled to take, DTC would authorize the participants to take such action, and that\nparticipants would authorize beneficial\nowners owning through such participants to take such action or would otherwise act upon the instructions\nof beneficial owners owning through them. No beneficial owner of an interest in a global security will be\nable to transfer such interest except\nin accordance with DTC\x92s applicable procedures, in addition to those provided for under the Indenture.\nBecause DTC can only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf of others, the ability of a\nperson having a beneficial interest\nin a global security to pledge that interest to persons that do not participate in the DTC system, or\notherwise to take actions in respect of that interest, may be impaired by the lack of a physical\ncertificate representing that interest.\n\nAll payments on the New Notes represented by a global security registered in the name of and held by DTC\nor its nominee will be made to DTC or its\nnominee, as the case may be, as the registered owner and holder of the global security.\n\nThe trustee will wire payments on the New Notes to\nDTC\x92s nominee. The trustee and we will treat DTC\x92s nominee as the owner of each global security for all\npurposes. Accordingly, the trustee, any paying agent and we will have no direct responsibility or\nliability to pay amounts due on a\nglobal security to you or any other beneficial owners in that global security. Any redemption notices\nwill be sent by us directly to DTC, which will, in turn, inform the direct participants (or the indirect\nparticipants), which will then contact you\nas a beneficial holder.\n\nIt is DTC\x92s current practice, upon receipt of any payment of principal, interest, redemption prices,\ndistributions or\nliquidation amounts, to credit direct participants\x92 accounts proportionately on the payment date based on\ntheir holdings. In addition, it is DTC\x92s current practice to pass through any consenting or voting rights\nto such participants by\nusing an omnibus proxy. Those participants will, in turn, make payments to and solicit votes from you,\nthe beneficial owner of notes, based on their customary practices. Payments to you will be the\nresponsibility of the participants and not of DTC,\nthe trustee or our company.\n\nUnless and until it is exchanged in whole or in part for certificated New Notes, each global security may\nnot be\ntransferred except as a whole by DTC to a nominee of DTC or by a nominee of DTC to DTC or another nominee\nof DTC. Transfers between participants in DTC will be effected in the ordinary way in accordance with DTC\nrules and will be settled in same-day funds.\n\n41\n\nWe expect that DTC will take any action permitted to be taken by a holder of New Notes only at the\ndirection of one or more participants to whose account the DTC interests in a global security are\ncredited and only in respect of such portion of the aggregate principal amount of the New Notes as to\nwhich such participant or participants has or have given such direction. However, if there is an event of\ndefault under the New Notes, DTC will exchange each global security for certificated New Notes, which it\nwill distribute to its participants. Although we expect that DTC will agree to the foregoing procedures\nin order to facilitate transfers of interests in each global security among participants of DTC, DTC is\nunder no obligation to perform or continue to perform such procedures, and such procedures may be\ndiscontinued at any time. None of we, the Dealer Managers or the trustee will have any responsibility for\nthe performance or nonperformance by DTC or its participants or indirect participants of their respective\nobligations under the rules and procedures governing their operations. The Indenture provides that the\nglobal securities will be exchanged for New Notes in certificated form of like tenor and of an equal\nprincipal amount, in authorized denominations in the following limited circumstances:\n                                                                                                         \n       DTC notifies us that it is unwilling or unable to continue as depository or if DTC ceases to be   \n  (i)  eligible under the                                                                                \n       Indenture and we do not appoint a successor depository within 90 days;                            \n                                                                                                         \n                                                                                                         \n        we determine that the New Notes will no longer be represented by global securities and execute   \n  (ii)  and deliver to the trustee                                                                       \n        an order to such effect; or                                                                      \n                                                                                                         \n                                                                                                  \n  (iii)  an event of default with respect to the New Notes will have occurred and be continuing.  \n                                                                                                  \nThese certificated New Notes will be registered in such name or names as DTC will instruct the trustee.\nIt is expected that such instructions may be based upon directions received by DTC from participants with\nrespect to ownership of beneficial interests in global securities. The information in this section of\nthis prospectus concerning DTC and DTC\x92s book-entry system has been obtained from sources that we believe\nto be reliable, but we do not take responsibility for this information. Euroclear and Clearstream If the\ndepositary for a global security is DTC, you may hold interests in the global security through\nClearstream Banking, société anonyme, which we refer to as \x93Clearstream,\x94 or Euroclear Bank SA/ NV, as\noperator of the Euroclear System, which we refer to as \x93Euroclear,\x94 in each case, as a participant in\nDTC. Euroclear and Clearstream will hold interests, in each case, on behalf of their participants through\ncustomers\x92 securities accounts in the names of Euroclear and Clearstream on the books of their respective\ndepositaries, which in turn will hold such interests in customers\x92 securities in the depositaries\x92 names\non DTC\x92s books. Links have been established among DTC, Clearstream and Euroclear to facilitate the\ninitial issuance of the New Notes sold outside of the United States and cross-market transfers of the\nnotes associated with secondary market trading. Although DTC, Clearstream and Euroclear have agreed to\nthe procedures described below in order to facilitate transfers, they are under no obligation to perform\nthese procedures, and these procedures may be modified or discontinued at any time. 42\n\nClearstream and Euroclear will record the ownership interests of their participants in much the same\nway as DTC, and DTC will record the total ownership of each of the U.S. agents of Clearstream and\nEuroclear, as participants in DTC. When New Notes are to be transferred from the account of a DTC\nparticipant to the account of a Clearstream\nparticipant or a Euroclear participant, the purchaser must send instructions to Clearstream or Euroclear\nthrough a participant at least one day prior to settlement. Clearstream or Euroclear, as the case may be,\nwill instruct its U.S. agent to\nreceive New Notes against payment. After settlement, Clearstream or Euroclear will credit its\nparticipant\x92s account. Credit for the New Notes will appear on the next day (European time).\n\nBecause settlement is taking place during New York business hours, DTC participants will be able to\nemploy their usual procedures for sending New Notes\nto the relevant U.S. agent acting for the benefit of Clearstream or Euroclear participants. The sale\nproceeds will be available to the DTC seller on the settlement date. As a result, to the DTC participant,\na cross-market transaction will settle no\ndifferently than a trade between two DTC participants.\n\nWhen a Clearstream or Euroclear participant wishes to transfer New Notes to a DTC\nparticipant, the seller will be required to send instructions to Clearstream or Euroclear through a\nparticipant at least one business day prior to settlement. In these cases, Clearstream or Euroclear will\ninstruct its U.S. agent to transfer these\nNew Notes against payment for them. The payment will then be reflected in the account of the Clearstream\nor Euroclear participant the following day, with the proceeds back-valued to the value date, which would\nbe the preceding day, when settlement\noccurs in New York. If settlement is not completed on the intended value date, that is, the trade fails,\nproceeds credited to the Clearstream or Euroclear participant\x92s account will instead be valued as of the\nactual settlement date.\n\nYou should be aware that you will only be able to make and receive deliveries, payments and other\ncommunications involving the New Notes through\nClearstream and Euroclear on the days when those clearing systems are open for business. Those systems\nmay not be open for business on days when banks, brokers and other institutions are open for business in\nthe United States. In addition, because\nof time zone differences there may be problems with completing transactions involving Clearstream and\nEuroclear on the same business day as in the United States.\n\nDischarge, Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance\n\nWe may\ndischarge certain obligations to holders of the New Notes of a series that have not already been\ndelivered to the trustee for cancellation and that either have become due and payable or will become due\nand payable within one year (or scheduled for\nredemption within one year) by depositing with the trustee, in trust, funds in U.S. dollars in an amount\nsufficient to pay the entire indebtedness including the principal and premium, if any, and interest to\nthe date of such deposit (if the New\nNotes have become due and payable) or to the maturity thereof or the redemption date of the New Notes of\nthat series, as the case may be. We may direct the trustee to invest such funds in U.S. Treasury\nsecurities with a maturity of one year or less\nor in a money market fund that invests solely in short-term U.S. Treasury securities.\n\nThe Indenture provides that we may elect either (1) to\ndefease and be discharged from any and all obligations with respect to the New Notes of a series (except\nfor, among other things, obligations to register the transfer or exchange of the New Notes, to replace\ntemporary or mutilated, destroyed, lost\nor stolen New Notes, to maintain an office or agency with respect to the New Notes and to hold moneys for\npayment in trust) (\x93legal defeasance\x94) or (2) to be released from our obligations to comply with the\nrestrictive covenants under\nthe Indenture, and any omission to comply with such obligations will not constitute a default or an event\nof default with respect to the New Notes of a series and clauses (4) and (7) under the heading \x93Events of\nDefault\x94 in the\nIndenture will no longer be applied (\x93covenant defeasance\x94). Legal defeasance or covenant defeasance, as\nthe case may be, will be conditioned\n\n43\n\nupon, among other things, the irrevocable deposit by us with the trustee, in trust, of an amount in U.S.\ndollars, or U.S. government obligations, or both, applicable to the New Notes of that\nseries which through the scheduled payment of principal and interest in accordance with their terms will\nprovide money in an amount sufficient to pay the principal or premium, if any, and interest on the New\nNotes on the scheduled due dates\ntherefor.\n\nIf we effect covenant defeasance with respect to the New Notes of any series, the amount in U.S. dollars,\nor U.S. government obligations,\nor both, on deposit with the trustee will be sufficient, in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm\nof independent accountants, to pay amounts due on the New Notes of that series at the time of the stated\nmaturity but may not be sufficient to\npay amounts due on the New Notes of that series at the time of the acceleration resulting from such event\nof default. However, we would remain liable to make payment of such amounts due at the time of\nacceleration.\n\nWe will be required to deliver to the trustee an opinion of counsel that the deposit and related\ndefeasance will not cause the holders of the New Notes\nof that series to recognize gain or loss for federal income tax purposes. If we elect legal defeasance,\nthat opinion of counsel must be based upon a ruling from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service or a change in\nlaw to that effect.\n\nWe may exercise our legal defeasance option notwithstanding our prior exercise of our covenant defeasance\noption.\n\nTrustee, Paying Agent and Security Registrar\n\nThe Bank of New\nYork Mellon Trust Company, N.A. is the trustee, paying agent and security registrar for the notes offered\nhereby. The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. is a national banking association organized under\nand governed by the laws of the\nUnited States of America, and provides trust services and acts as indenture trustee for numerous\ncorporate securities issuances, including for other series of debt securities of which we are the issuer.\n\nGoverning Law\n\nThe Indenture and the New Notes will be\ngoverned by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.\n\n44\n\nCERTAIN U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS\n\nThe following discussion summarizes certain U.S. federal income tax consequences to U.S. Holders and\nNon-U.S.\nHolders (each term as defined below) of the Exchange Offers and the ownership and disposition of any New\nNotes acquired in the Exchange Offers. This summary is based upon the provisions of the U.S. Internal\nRevenue Code of 1986, as amended (the\n\x93Code\x94), proposed, temporary and final Treasury regulations promulgated under the Code, and\nadministrative rulings and judicial decisions, in each case as of the date of this prospectus. These\nauthorities are subject to differing\ninterpretations and may be changed, perhaps retroactively, resulting in U.S. federal income tax\nconsequences different from those discussed below. We have not obtained, nor do we intend to obtain, a\nruling from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the\n\x93IRS\x94) with respect to the statements made and the conclusions reached in the following summary, and\nthere can be no assurance that the IRS will agree with such statements and conclusions.\n\nThis summary assumes that the Existing Notes are, and any New Notes will be, held as capital assets\nwithin the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code\n(generally, property held for investment). This summary does not address other U.S. federal tax laws\n(such as Medicare contribution tax laws and estate and gift tax laws) or the tax considerations arising\nunder the laws of any state, local or non-U.S. jurisdiction. In addition, this summary does not address\nall tax considerations that may be applicable to a particular holder\x92s circumstances or to holders that\nmay be subject to special tax rules,\nincluding, without limitation, holders subject to the alternative minimum tax, banks, insurance companies\nor other financial institutions, regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts,\ntax-exempt organizations, dealers in securities or currencies, traders in securities that elect to use a\nmark-to-market method of\ntax accounting for their securities holdings, U.S. Holders whose \x93functional currency\x94 is not the U.S.\ndollar, controlled foreign corporations, passive foreign investment companies, U.S. expatriates,\npartnerships or other pass-through\nentities for U.S. federal income tax purposes, holders holding the Existing Notes or the New Notes as a\nposition in a hedging transaction, \x93straddle,\x94 \x93conversion transaction\x94 or other risk reduction\ntransaction, holders deemed\nto sell the Existing Notes or the New Notes under the constructive sale provisions of the Code, holders\nrequired to accelerate the recognition of any item of gross income with respect to the Existing Notes or\nthe New Notes as a result of such income\nbeing recognized on an applicable financial statement, or subsequent purchasers of the New Notes.\n\nFor purposes of this discussion, a \x93U.S.\nHolder\x94 is a beneficial owner of the Existing Notes or the New Notes that is, for U.S. federal income tax\npurposes: (i) a citizen or individual resident of the United States, (ii) a corporation, including any\nentity treated as a\ncorporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, created or organized in, or under the laws of, the\nUnited States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia, (iii) an estate the income of which is\nsubject to U.S. federal income taxation\nregardless of its source, or (iv) a trust, if its administration is subject to the primary supervision of\na U.S. court and one or more United States persons have the authority to control all substantial\ndecisions of the trust, or if it has made\na valid election under applicable Treasury regulations to be treated as a United States person.\n\nFor purposes of this discussion, a \x93Non-U.S. Holder\x94 is a beneficial owner of the Existing Notes or the\nNew Notes that is neither a U.S. Holder nor a partnership or other entity treated as a partnership for\nU.S. federal income tax purposes.\n\nIf a partnership (or other entity treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) holds\nthe Existing Notes or the New Notes, the tax\ntreatment of a partner in the partnership will depend upon the status of the partner and the activities\nof the partnership. If you are a partnership or a partner in a partnership holding the Existing Notes or\nthe New Notes, you should consult your\ntax advisor regarding the tax consequences of the Exchange Offers and the ownership and disposition of\nany New Notes acquired in the Exchange Offers.\n\n45\n\nWe believe, and the following discussion assumes, that the Existing Notes are, and the New Notes will\nbe, treated as debt for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\n\nThis summary is for general information purposes only, and is not intended to be, and\nshould not be construed to be, legal or tax advice to any particular holder. You are urged to consult\nyour tax advisor with regard to the application of the U.S. federal income tax laws, as well as the\napplication of\nnon-income tax laws and the laws of any state, local or non-U.S. taxing jurisdiction, to your particular\nsituation.\n\nTax Consequences to Exchanging U.S. Holders\n\nTax Consequences of the Exchange\n\nUnder general principles of U.S. federal income tax law, the modification of a debt instrument can give\nrise to an exchange under\nSection 1001 of the Code upon which gain or loss is realized if the modified debt instrument differs\nmaterially either in kind or in extent from the original debt instrument. In this regard, governing\nTreasury regulations (the\n\x93Modification Regulations\x94) provide that, as a general rule, an exchange occurs when, based on all the\nfacts and circumstances and taking into account all changes in the terms of the debt instrument\ncollectively (other than certain\nspecified changes), the legal rights or obligations that are altered, and the degree to which they are\naltered, are economically significant (a \x93significant modification\x94). The Modification Regulations can\napply to any modification of a\ndebt instrument, regardless of the form of the modification, including an exchange of a new debt\ninstrument for an existing debt instrument. Therefore, the Modification Regulations are relevant in\ndetermining the consequences of an exchange of\nExisting Notes for New Notes pursuant to the Exchange Offers.\n\nUnder the Modification Regulations, a change in yield of a debt instrument is a\nsignificant modification if the yield of the modified debt instrument varies from the yield on the\nunmodified instrument (determined as of the date of the modification) by more than the greater of (i) 25\nbasis points and (ii) 5 percent of the\nannual yield of the unmodified instrument. For this purpose, the yield of the modified debt instrument is\nthe annual yield of a debt instrument with (i) an issue price equal to the adjusted issue price of the\nunmodified debt instrument on the\ndate of the modification (increased by accrued but unpaid interest and decreased by payments made to the\nholder as consideration for the modification) and (ii) payments equal to the payments on the modified\ndebt instrument from the date of the\nmodification. The Modification Regulations also provide that, in general, a modification of a debt\ninstrument that results in a material deferral of scheduled payments, including an extension of the final\nmaturity date, is a significant\nmodification. However, the Modification Regulations provide that a deferral is not a material deferral if\nthe deferred payments are unconditionally payable no later than at the end of a safe harbor period which\nbegins on the original due date of the\nfirst scheduled payment that is deferred and extends for a period equal to the lesser of (i) five years\nor (ii) 50% of the original term of the debt instrument.\n\nWe intend to take the position, and the following discussion assumes, that the exchange of Existing Notes\nfor New Notes pursuant to the Exchange Offers\nwill, in each case, constitute a significant modification under the Modification Regulations. Therefore,\nyou will generally recognize gain or loss in full upon the exchange of Existing Notes for New Notes\nunless the exchange qualifies as a\nrecapitalization for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\n\nIn order for the exchange to qualify as a recapitalization, the Existing Notes surrendered\nand the New Notes received must be treated as \x93securities\x94 under the relevant provisions of the Code.\nNeither the Code nor the Treasury regulations define the term security. Whether a debt instrument is a\nsecurity is based on all of the\nfacts and circumstances, but most authorities have held that the term to maturity\n\n46\n\nof the debt instrument is one of the most significant factors. In this regard, debt instruments with a\nterm of ten years or more generally have qualified as securities, whereas debt instruments\nwith a term of less than five years generally have not qualified as securities. Each series of Existing\nNotes had an initial term of more than ten years and the New Notes will have a term of more than ten\nyears.Thus, although the matter is\nnot free from doubt, we believe, and the following discussion assumes, that the Existing Notes and the\nNew Notes would both be treated as securities and that the exchange of Existing Notes for New Notes will\nbe treated as a recapitalization for U.S.\nfederal income tax purposes. There can be no assurance, however, that the IRS will not challenge the\ntreatment of the exchange of Existing Notes for New Notes as a recapitalization, and any such challenge,\nif successful, would generally result in\nconsequences different than those described below. You should consult your tax advisor regarding the\nqualification of the exchange as a recapitalization for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\n\nUpon the exchange of Existing Notes for New Notes pursuant to the Exchange Offers, you will, subject to\nthe discussions under \x93\x97Early Exchange\nPremium\x94 and \x93\x97Cash in Lieu of Fractional New Notes,\x94 generally recognize gain (but not loss) equal to\nthe lesser of (i) the amount of any gain realized on the exchange, computed in the manner described\nbelow, and\n(ii) cash received in the exchange (other than cash paid in respect of accrued and unpaid interest on the\nExisting Notes, the treatment of which is described below under \x93\x97Accrued and Unpaid Interest\x94). The\ngain, if any, realized\non the exchange will equal the difference between (i) the sum of the \x93issue price\x94 of the New Notes\nreceived (as described below under \x93\x97Issue Price of the New Notes\x94) and the cash received (other than\ncash paid in\nrespect of accrued and unpaid interest on the Existing Notes), and (ii) your adjusted tax basis in the\nExisting Notes surrendered. Your adjusted tax basis in the Existing Notes will generally equal the amount\npaid therefor, increased by market\ndiscount, if any, previously included in income and reduced by any bond premium previously amortized.\nSubject to the discussions under \x93\x97Market Discount\x94 and \x93\x97Early Exchange Premium,\x94 any gain recognized in\nthe\nexchange will be capital gain and will be long-term capital gain if you held the Existing Notes for more\nthan one year prior to the date of the exchange. Long-term capital gains of non-corporate U.S. Holders\n(including individuals) are eligible for reduced rates of taxation. You will have an initial tax basis in\nthe New Notes equal to your adjusted tax basis in the Existing Notes surrendered in the exchange,\nincreased by any gain that you recognize in\nthe exchange, and decreased by any cash received in the exchange (other than cash paid in respect of\naccrued and unpaid interest on the Existing Notes). In addition, your holding period for the New Notes\nwill include your holding period for the\nExisting Notes surrendered in the Exchange Offers.\n\nIf you hold Existing Notes with differing tax bases and/or holding periods, the preceding rules\nmust be applied separately to each identifiable block of Existing Notes.\n\nIssue Price of the New Notes. The determination of the issue price\nof the New Notes will depend on whether the New Notes and/or the Existing Notes exchanged therefor are\n\x93publicly traded\x94 for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If the New Notes are publicly traded, they\ngenerally will have an issue price\nequal to their fair market value on the date of issuance. We expect that the New Notes will be publicly\ntraded, and, thus, that each series of New Notes will have an issue price equal to their fair market\nvalue on the date of issuance. If we\ndetermine that the New Notes are publicly traded for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we will make that\ndetermination as well as our determination of the fair market value of the New Notes available to holders\nin a commercially reasonable fashion,\nincluding by electronic publication, within 90 days of the date that the New Notes are issued.\n\nMarket Discount. You will be considered to\nhave acquired an Existing Note with \x93market discount\x94 if the stated principal amount of such Existing\nNote exceeded your initial tax basis for such Existing Note by more than a de minimis amount. If your\nExisting Notes were acquired\nwith market discount, any gain recognized on the exchange of Existing Notes for New Notes will be treated\nas ordinary income (and will not receive capital gain treatment) to the extent of the market discount\naccrued during\n\n47\n\nyour period of ownership, unless you previously had elected to include market discount in income as it\naccrued for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Any accrued market discount on the Existing\nNotes that was not previously included in income (including in connection with the exchange) will\ngenerally carry over to the New Notes. The New Notes received will also be treated as acquired with\nmarket discount (including any accrued market\ndiscount described above) if their stated principal amount (or their issue price if the New Notes are\nissued with original issue discount as described below) exceeds your initial tax basis in such New Notes\nby more than a de minimis amount.\n\nIf you acquired your Existing Notes (other than at original issuance) for a price less than their stated\nprincipal amount, you should consult your\ntax advisor regarding the possible application of the market discount rules.\n\nEarly Exchange Premium. If you tender your Existing Notes on or\nbefore the Early Exchange Time, you will be eligible to receive the Early Exchange Premium. Although the\nU.S. federal income tax treatment of the receipt of the Early Exchange Premium is unclear, we intend to\ntake the position, and this discussion\nassumes, that the Early Exchange Premium should be treated as additional consideration received in\nexchange for the Existing Notes. However, the IRS could take the position that the Early Exchange Premium\ninstead should be treated as a separate fee\nthat would be subject to tax as ordinary income. You are urged to consult your tax advisor with respect\nto the U.S. federal income tax treatment of the Early Exchange Premium.\n\nCash in Lieu of Fractional New Notes. If you receive cash in lieu of fractional amounts of New Notes, you\nwill generally be treated as having\nreceived fractional New Notes corresponding to such fractional amounts pursuant to the Exchange Offers\nand then as having had those fractional New Notes sold for cash. As a result, you will generally\nrecognize gain or loss on the receipt of cash in\nlieu of fractional New Notes, which gain or loss will generally be determined as described below under\n\x93\x97Tax Consequences of the Ownership of the New Notes\x97Sale, Exchange or Retirement of the New Notes.\x94\n\nAccrued and Unpaid Interest. Any amount received pursuant to the Exchange Offers that is properly\nallocable to accrued and unpaid interest on an\nExisting Note will generally be includible in your gross income as ordinary interest income if such\naccrued interest had not been included previously in your gross income for U.S. federal income tax\npurposes.\n\nTax Consequences of the Ownership of the New Notes\n\nPayments of Interest. Payments of stated interest on the New Notes will be taxed to you as ordinary\nincome at the time the interest is paid or\naccrued in accordance with your method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\n\nOriginal Issue Discount. If the issue price of\nthe New Notes of a series (as described above under \x93\x97Tax Consequences of the Exchange\x97Issue Price of the\nNew Notes\x94) is less than their stated principal amount by more than a specified de minimisamount, such\nNew Notes\nwill be treated as issued with original issue discount (\x93OID\x94) in an amount equal to such difference. For\nthese purposes, the discount will be considered to exceed the de minimisthreshold if it is at least equal\nto 0.25% of the\nstated principal amount of the New Notes multiplied by the number of complete years to maturity from the\nissue date of the New Notes.\n\nYou must\ngenerally include OID in your gross income (as ordinary income) as it accrues (on a constant yield to\nmaturity basis) over the term of a New Note without regard to your regular method of accounting for U.S.\nfederal income tax purposes and in advance\nof the receipt of cash payments attributable to that income.\n\n48\n\nThe amount of OID, if any, that you must include in income with respect to a New Note will generally\nequal the sum of the \x93daily portions\x94 of OID with respect to the New Note for each day during the taxable\nyear or portion of the taxable year in which you held such New Note (\x93accrued OID\x94). The daily portion is\ndetermined by\nallocating to each day in each \x93accrual period\x94 a pro rata portion of the OID allocable to that accrual\nperiod. The \x93accrual period\x94 for a New Note may be of any length and may vary in length over the term of\nthe New Note,\nprovided that each accrual period is no longer than one year and each scheduled payment of principal or\ninterest occurs on the first day or the final day of an accrual period. The amount of OID allocable to\nany accrual period other than the final\naccrual period is an amount equal to the excess, if any, of (i) the product of the New Note\x92s adjusted\nissue price at the beginning of such accrual period and its yield to maturity (determined on the basis of\ncompounding at the close of\neach accrual period and properly adjusted for the length of the accrual period) over (ii) the aggregate\nof all stated interest allocable to the accrual period. OID allocable to a final accrual period is the\ndifference between the amount payable\nat maturity (other than a payment of stated interest) and the adjusted issue price of the New Note at the\nbeginning of the final accrual period. The adjusted issue price of a New Note at the beginning of any\naccrual period is equal to its issue\nprice, increased by the accrued OID, if any, for each prior accrual period (determined without regard to\nthe amortization of any acquisition premium or amortizable bond premium, as discussed below). Under these\nrules, you generally will have to\ninclude in income increasingly greater amounts of OID in successive accrual periods.\n\nIf your initial tax basis in a New Note is greater than its\nissue price and less than or equal to its stated principal amount, the New Note will be considered to\nhave been issued to you at an \x93acquisition premium.\x94 Under the acquisition premium rules, the amount of\nOID that you must include in\ngross income with respect to the New Note for any taxable year will be reduced by the portion of the\nacquisition premium properly allocable to that year.\n\nYou may elect to treat all interest (including stated interest, OID or de minimisOID, and market discount\nor de minimismarket discount,\nas adjusted by any acquisition premium or amortizable bond premium) on a New Note as OID and calculate\nthe amount includible in gross income under the constant yield method described above. The election must\nbe made for the taxable year in which you\nacquire the New Note, and may not be revoked without the consent of the IRS. You should consult your tax\nadvisor about this election. This discussion assumes this election is not made.\n\nAmortizable Bond Premium. If your initial tax basis in a New Note is greater than its stated principal\namount, you will be considered to have\nacquired the New Note with \x93amortizable bond premium\x94 and, in the case of any New Notes issued with OID,\nyou will not be required to include any OID in income. You generally may elect to amortize the premium\nover the remaining term of the\nNew Note on a constant yield method as an offset to interest when includible in income under your regular\naccounting method. However, because the New Notes may be redeemed by us prior to maturity at a premium,\nspecial rules apply that may reduce,\neliminate or defer the amount of premium that you may amortize with respect to a New Note. You should\nconsult your tax advisor about these special rules. If you do not elect to amortize the premium, that\npremium will decrease the gain or increase\nthe loss you would otherwise recognize on maturity or disposition of the New Note. An election to\namortize premium on a constant yield method will also apply to all other taxable debt instruments held or\nsubsequently acquired by you on or after the\nfirst day of the first taxable year for which the election is made. Such an election may not be revoked\nwithout the consent of the IRS. You should consult your tax advisor about this election.\n\nMarket Discount. If your New Notes have market discount (see \x93\x97Tax Consequences of the Exchange\x97 Market\nDiscount\x94 above),\nunder the market discount rules, you will be required to treat any gain on the sale, exchange or\nretirement of such New Notes as ordinary income to the extent of the market discount that is treated as\nhaving accrued on such New Notes at the time of\nthe sale,\n\n49\n\nexchange or retirement, and which you have not previously included in income. Any market discount will be\nconsidered to accrue ratably during the period from the date of acquisition to the maturity date of the\nNew Notes unless you elect to accrue on a constant interest method. You may elect to include market\ndiscount in income currently as it accrues, on either a ratable or constant interest method, in which\ncase any gain recognized will not be recharacterized as ordinary income. Sale, Exchange or Retirement of\nthe New Notes. Unless a non-recognitionprovision applies, you will recognize taxable gain or loss upon a\nsale, exchange or retirement of a New Note in an amount equal to the difference between (i) the amount of\ncash and the fair market value of any property received (less an amount equal to any accrued but unpaid\nstated interest, which will be taxed in the manner described above under \x93\x97Payments of Interest\x94) and\n(ii) your adjusted tax basis in the New Note. Your adjusted tax basis in a New Note will be your initial\ntax basis in the New Note, increased by any OID or market discount previously included in income, and\nreduced by any amortized bond premium. Any gain or loss on the sale, exchange or retirement of a New Note\nwill be capital gain or loss (although all or a portion of any recognized gain could be subject to\nordinary income treatment if there is any accrued market discount on the New Note that has not been\nincluded in income at the time of the sale, exchange or retirement, as discussed above under \x93\x97Market\nDiscount\x94) and will be long-term capital gain or loss if the New Note has a holding period of more than\none year at the time of the sale, exchange or retirement. Long-term capital gains of non-corporateU.S.\nHolders (including individuals) are eligible for reduced rates of taxation. The deductibility of capital\nlosses is subject to limitations. Tax Consequences to Exchanging Non-U.S.Holders The following discussion\nis a summary of certain U.S. federal income tax consequences that will apply to you if you are a\nNon-U.S.Holder who exchanges Existing Notes for New Notes pursuant to the Exchange Offers. For purposes\nof the discussion below, any income or gain will be considered to be \x93U.S. trade or business income\x94 if\nsuch income or gain is:\n                                                                                \n      effectively connected with your conduct of a U.S. trade or business; and  \n                                                                                \n                                                                                                         \n      if required by an applicable income tax treaty with the United States, attributable to a U.S.      \n      permanent establishment (or a                                                                      \n      fixed base) maintained by you in the United States.                                                \n                                                                                                         \nTax Consequences of the Exchange Subject to the discussions under \x93\x97Early Exchange Premium\x94 and \x93\x97Backup\nWithholding and Information Reporting\x97Non-U.S.Holders,\x94 you will generally not be subject to U.S. federal\nincome or withholding tax on any gain recognized on the exchange of Existing Notes for New Notes (which\ngain would be determined as described above under \x93\x97Tax Consequences to Exchanging U.S. Holders\x97Tax\nConsequences of the Exchange\x94) unless:\n                                                      \n      such gain is U.S. trade or business income; or  \n                                                      \n                                                                                                         \n      you are an individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable      \n      year in which the gain is                                                                          \n      realized and certain other conditions are met.                                                     \n                                                                                                         \nRegarding the first bullet above, a Non-U.S.Holder who realizes U.S. trade or business income with\nrespect to the exchange generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on that income in the 50\n\nsame manner as a U.S. Holder (see \x93\x97Tax Consequences to Exchanging U.S. Holders\x97Tax Consequences of the\nExchange\x94 above). In addition, if you are a foreign corporation, you may be subject to a branch profits\ntax equal to 30% (or lower applicable income tax treaty rate) of your effectively connected earnings and\nprofits, subject to adjustments. If you are an individual Non-U.S.Holder described in the second bullet\nabove, unless an applicable income tax treaty provides otherwise, you will generally be subject to a flat\n30% U.S. federal income tax on any gain recognized, which may be offset by certain U.S. source losses.\nAccrued and Unpaid Interest.

Subject to the discussion under \x93\x97Backup Withholding and\nInformation Reporting\x97Non-U.S.Holders,\x94 any gain realized upon the sale, exchange or retirement of a New\nNote will not be subject to U.S. federal income or withholding tax unless:\n                                                                                                         \n      the gain is U.S. trade or business income, in which case the gain will be subject to tax as        \n      described below under                                                                              \n      \x93\x97Effectively Connected Interest and Gain\x94; or                                                        \n                                                                                                         \n                                                                                                         \n      you are an individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable      \n      year of that sale, exchange                                                                        \n      or retirement, and certain other conditions are met, in which case the gain (net of certain U.S.   \n      source capital losses) will be subject to a flat 30% tax, unless an applicable income tax treaty   \n      provides otherwise.                                                                                \n                                                                                                         \nTo the extent proceeds from the sale, exchange or retirement of a New Note represent accrued and unpaid\nstated interest, you will generally be subject to U.S. federal income tax with respect to such accrued\nand unpaid stated interest in the same manner as described above under \x93\x97Payments of Interest.\x94\nEffectively Connected Interest and Gain. If any interest (including any OID) on, or gain realized upon\nthe disposition of, the New Notes is U.S. trade or business income, you will be subject to U.S. federal\nincome tax on that interest or gain on a net income basis (although you will be exempt from the 30% U.S.\nfederal withholding tax on interest, provided the certification requirements discussed above are\nsatisfied) in the same manner as if you were a U.S. Holder. In addition, if you are a foreign\ncorporation, you may be subject to an additional branch profits tax equal to 30% (or lower applicable\nincome tax treaty rate) of your effectively connected earnings and profits, subject to adjustments.\nBackup Withholding and Information Reporting U.S. Holders Information reporting requirements will\ngenerally apply to payments of interest on the Existing Notes or the New Notes, any OID accruals on the\nNew Notes, and proceeds from a disposition 52\n\n(including a retirement or redemption) of the Existing Notes or the New Notes (unless, in each case, you\nare an exempt recipient such as a corporation). Backup withholding may apply to any\npayments described in the preceding sentence if you fail to provide a taxpayer identification number or a\ncertification that you are not subject to backup withholding. Backup withholding is not an additional tax\nand any amounts withheld under the\nbackup withholding rules may be allowed as a refund or a credit against your U.S. federal income tax\nliability, provided that the required information is timely furnished to the IRS.\n\nNon-U.S.Holders\n\nInformation returns generally will be filed in connection with the amount of interest (including any OID)\npaid to you with respect to the Existing Notes\nor the New Notes and the amount of tax, if any, withheld with respect to such payments. Copies of the\ninformation returns reporting such interest payments and any withholding may also be made available to\nthe tax authorities in the country in which\nyou reside under the provisions of an applicable income tax treaty.\n\nIn general, you will not be subject to backup withholding with respect to\ninterest (including any OID) paid to you with respect to the Existing Notes or the New Notes, provided in\neach case that the applicable withholding agent does not have actual knowledge or reason to know that you\nare a United States person as defined\nunder the Code, and you have provided a validly completed applicable IRS Form W-8 establishing that you\nare not a United States person (or you satisfy certain documentary evidence requirements for establishing\nthat you are not a United States person).\n\nInformation reporting and, depending on the circumstances, backup withholding will apply to the proceeds\nof a sale or other disposition (including a retirement or redemption) of the Existing Notes or the New\nNotes made within the United States or conducted through certain United States-related financial\nintermediaries, unless you certify to the payor\nunder penalties of perjury that you are not a United States person as defined under the Code (and the\npayor does not have actual knowledge or reason to know that you are a United States person), or you\notherwise establish an exemption.\n\nBackup withholding is not an additional tax and any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules\nmay be allowed as a refund or a credit against\nyour U.S. federal income tax liability, provided that the required information is timely furnished to the\nIRS.\n\nAdditional Withholding Requirements\n\nUnder Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code (such Sections commonly referred to as \x93FATCA\x94), a 30% U.S.\nfederal withholding tax may apply to\nany interest (including any OID) paid on the Existing Notes or the New Notes to (i) a \x93foreign financial\ninstitution\x94 (as specifically defined in the Code) which does not provide sufficient documentation,\ntypically on IRS Form W-8BEN-E, evidencing either (x) an exemption from FATCA, or (y) its compliance (or\ndeemed compliance) with FATCA (which may alternatively be in the form of\ncompliance with an intergovernmental agreement with the United States) in a manner which avoids\nwithholding, or (ii) a \x93non-financial foreign entity\x94 (as specifically defined in the Code) which\ndoes not provide sufficient documentation, typically on IRS Form W-8BEN-E, evidencing either (x) an\nexemption from FATCA, or (y) adequate information regarding\ncertain substantial U.S. beneficial owners of such entity (if any). If an interest payment is both\nsubject to withholding under FATCA and subject to the withholding tax discussed above under \x93\x97Tax\nConsequences to Exchanging Non-U.S. Holders\x97Tax Consequences of the Exchange\x97Accrued and Unpaid Interest\x94\nand \x93\x97Tax Consequences to Exchanging Non-U.S. Holders\x97Tax\nConsequences of the Ownership of the New Notes\x97Payments of Interest,\x94 the withholding under FATCA may be\ncredited against, and therefore reduce, such other withholding tax.\n\n53\n\nHowever, any debt instrument issued before July 1, 2014 is generally treated as a\n\x93grandfathered obligation\x94 that is exempt from FATCA withholding (unless such debt instrument was the\nsubject of a \x93significant modification\x94 after such date). Accordingly, FATCA withholding is not expected\nto apply with respect\nto payments attributable to accrued and unpaid interest on the 5.200% Notes due 2039, the 4.500% Notes\ndue 2040, the 5.300% Notes due 2041, the 3.500% Notes due 2042, the 3.750% Notes due 2043 and the 4.875%\nNotes due 2043. In addition, while\nwithholding under FATCA would also have applied to payments of gross proceeds from a taxable disposition\nof the Existing Notes or the New Notes on or after January 1, 2019, proposed U.S. Treasury regulations\n(the preamble to which indicates\nthat taxpayers may rely on the regulations pending their finalization) eliminate FATCA withholding on\npayments of gross proceeds entirely.\n\nYou\nshould consult your tax advisor regarding these rules and whether they may be relevant to the exchange of\nthe Existing Notes pursuant to the Exchange Offers and your ownership and disposition of the New Notes.\n\nNon-ExchangingHolders\n\nIf you are a holder of Existing Notes that does not participate in the Exchange Offers, you will not\nrecognize any gain or loss in respect of the\nExchange Offers for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\n\n54\n\nNOTICES TO CERTAIN NON-U.S.HOLDERS\n\nGeneral\n\nNo action has been or will be taken\nin any non-U.S. jurisdiction that would permit a public offering of the New Notes or the possession,\ncirculation or distribution of this prospectus or any material relating to us, the Existing Notes or the\nNew\nNotes in any jurisdiction where action for that purpose is required.

Any resale of the New Notes must be made in accordance with an exemption\nfrom, or in a transaction not subject to,\nthe prospectus requirements of applicable securities laws.\n\nSecurities legislation in certain provinces or territories of Canada may provide a\npurchaser with remedies for rescission or damages if this offering memorandum (including any amendment\nthereto) contains a misrepresentation, provided that the remedies for rescission or damages are exercised\nby the purchaser within the time limit\nprescribed by the securities legislation of the purchaser\x92s province or territory. The purchaser should\nrefer to any applicable provisions of the securities legislation of the purchaser\x92s province or territory\nfor particulars of these\nrights or consult with a legal advisor.\n\nPursuant to section 3A.3 of National Instrument 33-105 Underwriting Conflicts (NI 33-105), the purchasers\nare not required to comply with the disclosure requirements of NI 33-105 regarding underwriter conflicts\nof\ninterest in connection with the Tender Offers and Solicitations.\n\n55\n\nHolders of Existing Notes that are located or resident in Canada must complete, sign and submit a\nCanadian Eligibility Form in the form approved by the Company and in accordance with the procedures\nestablished by the Company to confirm that they satisfy applicable Canadian securities law requirements\nand to provide certain additional information\nrequired for them to participate in the Exchange Offers.\n\nEuropean Economic Area\n\nThe New Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be\noffered, sold or otherwise made available to any\nretail investor in the EEA. For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of:\n(i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (ii) a customer within the\nmeaning of the Insurance\nDistribution Directive, where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in\npoint (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in the Prospectus\nRegulation. Consequently no key\ninformation document required by the PRIIPs Regulation for offering or selling the New Notes or otherwise\nmaking them available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering or selling\nthe New Notes or otherwise making them\navailable to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation.\n\nThis prospectus has been prepared on the basis that any\noffer of New Notes in any member state of the EEA will be made pursuant to an exemption under the\nProspectus Regulation from the requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of notes.

Consequently no key information\ndocument required by the PRIIPs Regulation as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the UK PRIIPs\nRegulation for offering or selling the New Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors\nin the UK has been prepared and therefore\noffering or selling the New Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the UK may\nbe unlawful under the UK PRIIPs Regulation.\n\nThis prospectus has been prepared on the basis that any offer of New Notes in the UK will be made\npursuant to an exemption under the UK Prospectus\nRegulation from the requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of notes.

Indemnification of Directors and Officers.\n\nSections 23B.08.510 and 23B.08.570 of the Washington Business Corporation Act (\x93WBCA\x94)\nauthorizes Washington corporations to indemnify their officers and directors under certain circumstances\nagainst expenses and liabilities incurred in legal proceedings involving them as a result of their\nservice as an officer or director.\nSection 23B.08.560 of the WBCA authorizes a corporation by provision in its articles of incorporation to\nindemnify or agree to indemnify a director made a party to a proceeding, or obligate itself to advance or\nreimburse expenses incurred in a\nproceeding, without regard to the limitations imposed by Sections 23B.08.510 through .550 of the WBCA;\nprovided, however, that no such indemnity shall be made for or on account of (a) acts or omissions of the\ndirector finally adjudged to be\nintentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law, (b) conduct of the director finally adjudged to be\nin violation of Section 23B.08.310 of the WBCA (relating to unlawful distributions) or (c) any\ntransaction with respect to which\nit was finally adjudged that the director personally received a benefit in money, property, or services\nto which the director is not legally entitled.\n\nThe Registrant\x92s Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation require indemnification of the\nRegistrant\x92s officers and directors and\nadvancement of expenses to the fullest extent not prohibited by applicable law. The Registrant\x92s Amended\nand Restated Articles of Incorporation provide for procedures for those seeking indemnification and/or\nadvancement of expenses. In\naddition, as authorized by Section 23B.08.320 of the WBCA, the Registrant\x92s Amended and Restated Articles\nof Incorporation contain a provision eliminating the personal liability of directors to the Registrant or\nits shareholders for\nmonetary damages for conduct as a director, except for (a) omissions involving intentional misconduct by\nthe director or a knowing violation of law by the director, (b) conduct violating Section 23B.08.310 of\nthe WBCA or (c) any\ntransaction from which the director will personally receive a benefit in money, property or services to\nwhich the director is not legally entitled.\n\nThe Registrant has established an indemnification trust (\x932016 Directors\x92 Trust\x94) to fund the\nRegistrant\x92s obligations to indemnify\nand/or advance expenses to directors arising from their board service in the event the Registrant does\nnot or is financially unable to provide the indemnification and/or advancement. As required by the 2016\nDirectors\x92 Trust agreement, the\nRegistrant has funded a minimum balance of principal assets of no less than $50 million in the trust. The\nRegistrant also has an indemnification trust (\x932016 Officers\x92 Trust\x94) that funds the Registrant\x92s\nindemnification\nobligations to certain past and present officers arising from their activities as such. As required by\nthe 2016 Officers\x92 Trust agreement, the Registrant has funded a minimum balance of principal assets of no\nless than $50 million in the\ntrust. The 2016 Directors\x92 Trust and 2016 Officers\x92 Trust are successors to certain trusts originally\nestablished in 1993, and amended from time to time, to fund Registrant\x92s indemnification obligations to\ndirectors and officers. The\nRegistrant has also entered into separate indemnification agreements with certain of its directors and\nexecutive officers.\n\nII-1\n\nItem 21.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, any increase or decrease in volume of securities offered (if\nthe total dollar value of securities offered would not exceed that which was registered) and any\ndeviation from the low or high end of the estimated maximum offering range may be reflected in the form\nof prospectus filed with the SEC II-6\n\npursuant to Rule 424(b) if, in the aggregate, the changes in volume and price represent no more than 20%\nchange in the maximum aggregate offering price set forth in the \x93Calculation of\nRegistration Fee\x94 table in the effective registration statement; and\n\n(iii) to include any material information with respect to\nthe plan of distribution not previously disclosed in the registration statement or any material change to\nsuch information in the registration statement;\n\n(2) that, for the purpose of determining any liability under the Securities Act, each such post-effective\namendment shall be deemed to be\na new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such\nsecurities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof;\n\n(3) to remove from registration by means of a post-effective amendment any of the securities being\nregistered which remain unsold at the\ntermination of the offering;\n\n(4) That, for the purpose of determining liability under the Securities Act to any purchaser, if the\nregistrants are subject to Rule 430C, each prospectus filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) as part of a\nregistration statement relating to an offering, other than registration statements relying on Rule 430B\nor other than prospectuses filed\nin reliance on Rule 430A, shall be deemed to be part of and included in the registration statement as of\nthe date it is first used after effectiveness. Provided, however, that no statement made in a\nregistration statement or prospectus that is\npart of the registration statement or made in a document incorporated or deemed incorporated by reference\ninto the registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement will, as to a\npurchaser with a time of contract of\nsale prior to such first use, supersede or modify any statement that was made in the registration\nstatement or prospectus that was part of the registration statement or made in any such document\nimmediately prior to such date of first use; and\n\n(5) that, for the purpose of determining liability of the registrant under the Securities Act to any\npurchaser in the initial\ndistribution of the securities, the undersigned registrant undertakes that in a primary offering of\nsecurities of the undersigned registrant pursuant to this registration statement, regardless of the\nunderwriting method used to sell the securities\nto the purchaser, if the securities are offered or sold to such purchaser by means of any of the\nfollowing communications, the undersigned registrant will be a seller to the purchaser and will be\nconsidered to offer or sell such securities to such\npurchaser:\n\n(i) Any preliminary prospectus or prospectus of the undersigned registrant relating to the offering\nrequired to be filed\npursuant to Rule 424;\n\n(ii) Any free writing prospectus relating to the offering prepared by or on behalf of the undersigned\nregistrant or used or referred to by the undersigned registrant;\n\n(iii) The portion of any other free writing prospectus relating to\nthe offering containing material information about the undersigned registrant or its securities provided\nby or on behalf of the undersigned registrant; and\n\n(iv) Any other communication that is an offer in the offering made by the undersigned registrant to the\npurchaser.\n\n(b) The undersigned registrant hereby undertakes that, for purposes of determining any liability under\nthe Securities Act, each filing of the\nregistrant\x92s annual report pursuant to section 13(a) or section 15(d) of the Exchange Act (and, where\napplicable, each filing of an employee benefit plan\x92s annual report pursuant to section 15(d) of the\nExchange Act), that is incorporated\nby reference in this registration statement shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating\nto the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be\nthe initial bona fide offering thereof.\n\nII-7\n\n(c) Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to\ndirectors, officers and controlling persons of the registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or\notherwise, the registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the SEC such indemnification is against\npublic policy as expressed in the\nSecurities Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against\nsuch liabilities (other than the payment by the registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director,\nofficer or controlling person of the\nregistrant in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director,\nofficer or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, the registrant will,\nunless in the opinion of its counsel the\nmatter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the\nquestion whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act\nand will be governed by the final\nadjudication of such issue.\n\n(d) The undersigned registrant hereby undertakes to respond to requests for information that is\nincorporated by\nreference into the prospectus pursuant to Items 4, 10(b), 11, or 13 of this Form, within one business day\nof receipt of such request, and to send the incorporated documents by first class mail or other equally\nprompt means.

Tenders of Existing Notes in\nthe Exchange Offers may be validly withdrawn at any time at or prior to the Expiration Time, but will\nthereafter be irrevocable, except in certain limited circumstances where additional withdrawal rights are\nrequired by law. The consummation of each Exchange Offer is subject to, and conditional upon, the\nsatisfaction or, where permitted, the waiver of the conditions discussed under \x93Description of the\nExchange Offers\x97Conditions to the Exchange Offers,\x94 including, among other things, the registration\nstatement on Form S-4of which this prospectus forms a part having been declared effective by the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission (the \x93SEC\x94) on or prior to the Expiration Time and remaining effective\non the Settlement Date (as defined in this prospectus).

The\nprincipal amount of each series of Existing Notes to be accepted pursuant to the Exchange Offers will be\nsubject to the \x93acceptance priority\nlevel\x94 (in numerical priority order) of such series as set forth in the applicable table on the front\ncover of this prospectus.\n\nWith respect\nto Existing Notes tendered in an Exchange Offer, and not validly withdrawn prior to the Expiration Time,\nsuch Existing Notes of a series having a higher acceptance priority level for such Exchange Offer will be\naccepted for exchange before any such\nExisting Notes of a series having a lower acceptance priority level. If acceptance of all validly\ntendered Existing Notes of a series would not result in us issuing New Notes having an aggregate\nprincipal amount in excess of the applicable New Issue\nCap, we will accept all validly tendered Existing Notes of such series. If acceptance of all validly\ntendered Existing Notes of a series would result in us issuing New Notes having an aggregate principal\namount in excess of the applicable New Issue\nCap, the tendered Existing Notes of such series will be accepted subject to proration as described more\nfully in this prospectus.\n\nThe completion of\nthe Exchange Offers for each series of Existing Notes is subject to, and conditional upon, the\nsatisfaction or waiver of certain conditions, including, among other things, (i) the registration\nstatement on Form\nS-4 of which this prospectus forms a part having been declared effective by the SEC on or prior to the\nExpiration Time and remaining effective on the Settlement Date; (ii) the condition that, as of the\nPricing Time, the combination of the yield of the New Notes and the Total Exchange Consideration for the\napplicable series of Existing Notes would result in the New Notes and such Existing Notes not being\ntreated as \x93substantially\ndifferent\x94 under FASB Accounting Standards Codification (\x93ASC\x94) 470-50 (the \x93Accounting Treatment\nCondition\x94); (iii) the requirement, with respect to the Exchange Offers of New Notes\nfor Existing Notes, that we issue at least (a) $500,000,000 aggregate principal amount of New 2050 Notes\nand (b) $500,000,000 aggregate principal amount of New 2060 Notes; (iv) the Yield Condition (as defined\nbelow) (for any applicable series\nof Existing Notes); and (v) that nothing has occurred or may occur that would or might, in our reasonable\njudgment, be expected to prohibit, prevent, restrict or delay an Exchange Offer or delay the scheduled\nPricing Time or impair us from\nrealizing the anticipated benefits of an Exchange Offer. We may, at our option, waive any such conditions\nat or by the Expiration Time, except the condition that the registration statement of which this\nprospectus forms a part has been declared\neffective by the SEC on or prior to the Expiration Time and remains effective on the Settlement Date. The\n\x93Settlement Date\x94 will promptly follow the Expiration Time and is expected to be June 1, 2020, which is\nthe second business day\nfollowing the Expiration Time. Tendering holders of Existing Notes must tender Existing Notes in minimum\ndenominations of $2,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof. New Notes will be issued in\nminimum denominations of $2,000 and\nintegral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof.\n\nIn our sole discretion and subject to applicable law, we reserve the right to remove one or more\nseries of Existing Notes from the Exchange Offers if we determine that the Accounting Treatment Condition\nor the Yield Condition for such series of Existing Notes will not be achieved. Any such decision will be\ndetermined as of the Pricing Time and\nwould be announced with the pricing terms. In the event we remove a particular series of Existing Notes\nfrom an Exchange Offer, the acceptance priority level for any series of Existing Notes below such series\nof notes removed will be adjusted\naccordingly.\n\ni\n\nThe Yield Condition Notwithstanding any other provision in this prospectus to the contrary, if, at the\nPricing Time, the yield of the 30-year Reference UST Security with respect to any series of Existing\nNotes (as set forth in the table below) is less than the applicable minimum yield or is greater than the\napplicable maximum yield with respect to such series of Existing Notes, then, unless this condition is\nwaived by us, we will not accept for exchange, or issue the applicable series of New Notes in exchange\nfor, any Existing Notes of such series tendered in the Exchange Offers (the \x93Yield Condition\x94).\n                                                                                           \n  Title of Security                                                                        \n  Pool 1 Notes             Reference UST Security          Minimum\xa0Yield    Maximum\xa0Yield  \n  4.875% Notes due 2043    2.375% due November\xa015, 2049    0.40%            2.35%          \n ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── \n  5.300% Notes due 2041    2.375% due November\xa015, 2049    0.40%            2.35%          \n  4.450% Notes due 2045    2.375% due November\xa015, 2049    0.40%            2.00%          \n  4.250% Notes due 2047    2.375% due November\xa015, 2049    0.40%            2.00%          \n  5.200% Notes due 2039    2.375% due November\xa015, 2049    0.40%            2.35%          \n  4.500% Notes due 2040    2.375% due November\xa015, 2049    0.40%            2.35%          \n  3.750% Notes due 2043    2.375% due November\xa015, 2049    0.40%            2.35%          \n  3.750% Notes due 2045    2.375% due November\xa015, 2049    0.40%            2.35%          \n  4.100% Notes due 2037    2.375% due November\xa015, 2049    0.40%            2.35%          \n  4.200% Notes due 2035    2.375% due November\xa015, 2049    0.40%            2.35%          \n  Pool 2 Notes                                                                             \n  4.750% Notes due 2055    2.375% due November\xa015, 2049    0.40%            2.25%          \n  4.000% Notes due 2055    2.375% due November\xa015, 2049    0.40%            2.35%          \n  4.500% Notes due 2057    2.375% due November\xa015, 2049    0.40%            2.10%          \n  3.950% Notes due 2056    2.375% due November\xa015, 2049    0.40%            1.80%          \n                                                                                           \nTotal Exchange Consideration and Exchange Consideration Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set\nforth in this prospectus: If you validly tender Existing Notes prior to the Early Exchange Time and do\nnot validly withdraw such tendered Existing Notes prior to the Expiration Time, and such Existing Notes\nare accepted by us, you will receive, for each $1,000 principal amount of Existing Notes tendered and\naccepted, a combination of a principal amount of New Notes and cash with an aggregate value equal to the\nTotal Exchange Consideration as follows:\n                                                                                                         \n       an aggregate principal amount of New Notes equal to (a)\xa0the Total Exchange Consideration for      \n  (i)  such Existing Notes                                                                               \n       minus (b)\xa0the Cash Component (as defined below);

As DTC (as defined below) is the record holder of the Existing Notes, all holders of any Existing\nNotes will also receive any applicable accrued and unpaid interest on those Existing Notes in accordance\nwith DTC procedures, regardless of the\nrecord dates with respect to each series of Existing Notes.\n\nThe \x93Pricing Time\x94 will be 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on May 14,\n2020, unless the Early Exchange Time is extended, in which case a new Pricing Time may be established\nwith respect to the Exchange Offers. In the event that the Early Exchange Time is not extended, the\nPricing Time will remain the same.\n\nThe \x93Total Exchange Consideration\x94 (calculated at the Pricing Time and in accordance with the formula set\nforth in Annex A to this prospectus,\nas illustrated by the hypothetical pricing example included in Annex B to this prospectus) for the\nExisting Notes validly tendered prior to the Early Exchange Time, and not validly withdrawn prior to the\nExpiration Time, is equal to the discounted\nvalue on the Settlement Date of the remaining payments of principal and interest per $1,000 principal\namount of the Existing Notes through the applicable maturity date or par call date (as applicable) of the\nExisting Notes, using a yield equal to\nthe sum of: (i) the bid-side yield on the 30-year Reference UST Security set forth with respect to each\nseries of Existing Notes on the front cover of this prospectus plus (ii) the applicable fixed\nspread set forth with respect to each series of Existing Notes on the front cover of this prospectus,\nminus accrued and unpaid interest on such series of Existing Notes to but not including the Settlement\nDate. For the avoidance of doubt, the $30\nper $1,000 Early Exchange Premium is included within the Total Exchange Consideration, as calculated\nusing the Fixed Spread over the 30-year Reference UST Security as described herein, and is not in\naddition to the Total Exchange Consideration.\n\nThe \x93Cash Component\x94 means the portion of the Total Exchange Consideration to be paid to holders in cash\nand is equal to (i) the\napplicable Cash Payment Percent of Premium for such series of Existing Notes multiplied by (ii) (a) the\napplicable Total Exchange Consideration for such series of Existing Notes minus (b) $1,000.\n\nThe \x93Cash Payment Percent of Premium\x94 is the percent (as set forth with respect to each series of\nExisting Notes on the front cover of this\nprospectus) of the amount by which the Total Exchange Consideration (as calculated at the Pricing Time\nand in accordance with the formula set forth in Annex A to this prospectus, as illustrated by the\nhypothetical pricing example included in Annex B\nto this prospectus) exceeds $1,000 per $1,000 principal amount of such Existing Notes.\n\nThe \x93Exchange Consideration\x94 for the Existing\nNotes validly tendered after the Early Exchange Time but prior to the Expiration Time is equal to the\nTotal Exchange Consideration minus the applicable Early Exchange Premium.\n\nSee \x93Description of the Exchange Offers\x97Total Exchange Consideration and Exchange Consideration.\x94\n\nEarly Exchange Premium\n\nTo encourage holders of Existing\nNotes to tender prior to the Early Exchange Time, the Total Exchange Consideration includes an Early\nExchange Premium of $30 principal amount of New 2050 Notes or $30 principal amount of New 2060 Notes, as\napplicable, for each $1,000 principal\namount of Existing Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn (the \x93Early Exchange Premium\x94). Only\nholders who validly tender their Existing Notes prior to the Early Exchange Time (and who do not validly\nwithdraw prior to the\nExpiration Time), and whose tenders are accepted for exchange pursuant to the Exchange Offers, will\nreceive the Early Exchange Premium.\n\niii\n\nUpon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this prospectus, holders who validly tender\ntheir Existing Notes after the Early Exchange Time but prior to the Expiration Time, and whose tenders\nare accepted for exchange by us, will receive only the Exchange Consideration, which does not include the\nEarly Exchange Premium.\n\nThe \x93Early Exchange Time\x94 is 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on May 13, 2020, unless extended, in which\ncase the Early Exchange Time will\nbe such time and date to which the Early Exchange Time is extended. The \x93Expiration Time\x94 is 11:59 p.m.,\nNew York City time, on May 28, 2020, unless extended, in which case the Expiration Time will be such time\nand date to which the\nExpiration Time is extended.\n\nSee \x93Description of the Exchange Offers\x97Total Exchange Consideration and Exchange Consideration\x97Early\nExchange Premium.\x94\n\nAdjustment of the Total Exchange Consideration and Exchange Consideration\n\nWe may, at our option, elect to increase or decrease the principal amount of (i) New 2050 Notes\nexchangeable for each $1,000 principal amount of the\napplicable Pool 1 Notes tendered and accepted by up to $100 per $1,000 principal amount and (ii) New 2060\nNotes exchangeable for each $1,000 principal amount of the applicable Pool 2 Notes tendered and accepted\nby up to $100 per $1,000\nprincipal amount. Such adjustments would affect the composition, but not the amount, of the Total\nExchange Consideration and the Exchange Consideration for the applicable Existing Notes. We expect any\nsuch election to be made as of the Pricing Time,\nwhich is scheduled to be the 10th business day prior to the Expiration Time.\n\niv\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n                                                             \n                                                       Page  \n  About this Prospectus                                   v  \n  Incorporation of Certain Information by Reference       v  \n  Important Information                                  vi  \n  Forward-Looking Statements                            vii  \n  Prospectus Summary                                      1  \n  Risk Factors                                           12  \n  Use of Proceeds                                        15  \n  Description of the Exchange Offers                     16  \n  Description of the New Notes                           32  \n  Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations         44  \n  Notices to Certain Non-U.S. Holders                    54  \n  Validity of the New Notes                              58  \n  Experts                                                58  \n  Where You Can Find More Information                    59  \n                                                             \nABOUT THIS PROSPECTUS As used in this prospectus, unless otherwise stated or the context otherwise\nrequires, \x93we,\x94 \x93us,\x94 the \x93Company,\x94 \x93our,\x94 or \x93Microsoft\x94 means Microsoft Corporation and its\nconsolidated subsidiaries.

IMPORTANT INFORMATION Prohibition on sales to EEA Retail Investors:The\nNew Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and are not being offered,\nsold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the European Economic Area or in the United\nKingdom. For these purposes, a \x93retail investor\x94 means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail\nclient as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of the EU Directive on Markets in Financial Instruments\n(2014/65/EU) (as amended, \x93MiFID II\x94); (ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive (EU) 2016/97 (the\n\x93Insurance Distribution Directive\x94), where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as\ndefined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in\nRegulation (EU) 2017/1129 (as amended, the \x93Prospectus Regulation\x94). Consequently, no key information\ndocument required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as amended, the \x93PRIIPs Regulation\x94) for offering or\nselling the New Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA or in the United\nKingdom has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the New Notes or otherwise making them\navailable to any retail investor in the EEA or in the United Kingdom may be unlawful.

This prospectus is not a prospectus for the purposes of the Prospectus\nRegulation. vi\n\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS Certain statements in this prospectus, any prospectus supplement and the\ndocuments incorporated by reference herein, other than purely historical information, including\nestimates, projections, statements relating to our business plans, objectives and expected operating\nresults, and the assumptions upon which those statements are based, are forward-looking statements.

See \x93Where You Can Find More\nInformation\x94 in this prospectus. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only risks\nfacing us and your investment in the New Notes. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware\nof, or those we currently deem less significant, also may become important factors that affect us. The\nfollowing risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of\noperations or liquidity. The value of the New Notes could decline due to any of these risks, and you may\nlose all or part of your investment.\n\nRisks Related to the Exchange Offers\n\nThe liquidity of the Existing Notes that are not exchanged will be reduced.\n\nWe expect that the trading market for unexchanged Existing Notes will become more limited than\nthe existing trading market and could cease to exist altogether due to the reduction in the amount of the\nExisting Notes outstanding upon consummation of the Exchange Offers. Because of the acceptance priority\nlevels, it is more likely that a\nreduction in the principal amount outstanding could occur with respect to a series of Existing Notes\nhaving a higher priority acceptance level. A more limited trading market for a particular series of\nExisting Notes might adversely affect the\nliquidity, market price and price volatility of such series of Existing Notes. If a market for\nunexchanged Existing Notes exists or develops, those securities may trade at a discount to the price at\nwhich the securities would trade if the amount\noutstanding were not reduced, depending on prevailing interest rates, the market for similar securities\nand other factors. However, we cannot assure you that an active market in the unexchanged Existing Notes\nwill exist, develop or be maintained or\nas to the prices at which the unexchanged Existing Notes may be traded.\n\nWe have not made a recommendation as to whether you should tender your Existing Notes in exchange for the\nNew Notes in the Exchange Offers, and we have not made a determination or obtained a third-party\ndetermination that the Exchange Offers are fair to holders of the Existing Notes.\n\nNeither we nor our board of directors has made, nor will either make, any recommendation as to whether\nholders of Existing Notes should tender their\nExisting Notes in exchange for the New Notes pursuant to the Exchange Offers. Furthermore, neither we nor\nour board of directors has made any determination that the consideration to be received represents a fair\nvaluation of the Existing Notes, and\nwe also have not retained, and do not intend to retain, any unaffiliated representative to act solely on\nbehalf of the holders of Existing Notes for purposes of negotiating the terms of the Exchange Offers, or\npreparing a report or making any\nrecommendation concerning the fairness of the Exchange Offers. Holders of Existing Notes must make their\nown independent decisions regarding their participation in the applicable Exchange Offer.\n\n12\n\nThe Exchange Offers may be cancelled or delayed.\n\nThe consummation of the Exchange Offers is subject to, and conditional upon, the satisfaction or, where\npermitted, waiver of the conditions specified in\nthis prospectus. See \x93Description of the Exchange Offers\x97Conditions to the Exchange Offers.\x94 In addition,\nif less than $500,000,000 of New 2050 Notes would be issued, then all Pool 1 Note tenders will be\ncancelled and no New 2050\nNotes will be created; and if less than $500,000,000 of New 2060 Notes would be issued, then all Pool 2\nNote tenders will be cancelled and no New 2060 Notes will be created. Further, each of the Exchange Offer\nmay be cancelled in whole or with\nrespect to specific series of Existing Notes, as applicable, if the applicable Yield Condition is not\nmet. Even if each of the Exchange Offers is completed, the Exchange Offers may not be completed on the\nschedule described in this prospectus.\nAccordingly, holders participating in the Exchange Offers may have to wait longer than they expect to\nreceive the New Notes.\n\nWe have established priorities for acceptance of the Existing Notes, which makes it more likely that\nholders of series of Existing Notes with a lower acceptance priority may be excluded from acceptance of\ntender. Any tenders that are accepted may be prorated.\n\nIf New Notes in an aggregate principal amount in excess of the applicable New Issue Cap are to be issued\npursuant to validly tendered Existing Notes in\nthe applicable Exchange Offer at the Expiration Time, we will accept tenders of Existing Notes by series\nin accordance with the \x93acceptance priority level\x94 (in numerical priority order) set forth in the\napplicable table on the front cover\nof this prospectus. With respect to Existing Notes tendered in an Exchange Offer, and not validly\nwithdrawn prior to the Expiration Time, such Existing Notes of a series having a higher acceptance\npriority level will be accepted for exchange before\nany such Existing Notes of a series having a lower acceptance priority level.\n\nIf acceptance of all validly tendered Existing Notes of a series\nwould result in us issuing New Notes having an aggregate principal amount in excess of the applicable New\nIssue Cap, the tendered Existing Notes of such series will be accepted subject to proration. See\n\x93Description of the Exchange\nOffers\x97Acceptance Priority Levels and Proration Procedures.\x94\n\nLate deliveries of Existing Notes or any other failure to comply with the Exchange Offer procedures could\nprevent a holder from exchanging its Existing Notes.\n\nHolders of Existing Notes are responsible for complying with all\nthe procedures of the Exchange Offers. The issuance of New Notes in exchange for Existing Notes will only\noccur upon proper completion of the procedures described in this prospectus under \x93Description of the\nExchange Offers.\x94 Therefore,\nholders of Existing Notes who wish to exchange their Existing Notes for New Notes should allow sufficient\ntime for timely completion of the procedures of the Exchange Offers. Neither we nor the Exchange Agent\nare obligated to extend the Exchange\nOffers or notify you of any failure to follow the proper procedures.\n\nWe may acquire New Notes in future transactions.\n\nWe may in the future seek to acquire New Notes in open market or privately-negotiated transactions,\nthrough subsequent exchange offers or otherwise. The\nterms of any of those purchases or offers could differ from the terms of these Exchange Offers and such\nother terms may be more or less favorable to holders of the New Notes.\n\n13\n\nRisks Related to the New Notes The Indenture governing the New Notes does not contain financial covenants\nor meaningful restrictions on us or our subsidiaries. Neither we nor any of our subsidiaries are\nrestricted from incurring additional debt or other liabilities, including debt secured by liens, under\nthe Indenture. We may from time to time incur additional debt and other liabilities. In addition, we are\nnot restricted from paying dividends or making distributions on our capital stock or purchasing or\nredeeming our capital stock under the Indenture. Active trading markets for the New Notes may not\ndevelop. The New Notes are new issues of securities with no established trading markets. We do not intend\nto apply for listing of the New Notes on any securities exchange. We cannot assure you trading markets\nfor the New Notes will develop or of the ability of holders of the New Notes to sell their notes or of\nthe prices at which holders may be able to sell their notes. The Dealer Managers have advised us that\nthey currently intend to make a market in each series of the New Notes. However, the Dealer Managers are\nnot obligated to do so, and any market-making with respect to the New Notes may be discontinued, in their\nsole discretion, at any time without notice. If no active trading markets develop, you may be unable to\nresell the New Notes at any price or at their fair market value. If trading markets do develop, changes\nin our ratings or the financial markets could adversely affect the market prices of the New Notes. The\nmarket prices of the New Notes will depend on many factors, including, among others, the following:\n                                                                   \n      ratings on our debt securities assigned by rating agencies;  \n                                                                   \n                                                                                  \n      the prevailing interest rates being paid by other companies similar to us;  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                         \n      our results of operations, financial condition and prospects; and  \n                                                                         \n                                               \n      the condition of the financial markets.  \n                                               \nThe condition of the financial markets and prevailing interest rates have fluctuated in the past and are\nlikely to fluctuate in the future, which could have an adverse effect on the market prices of the New\nNotes. Rating agencies continually review the ratings they have assigned to companies and debt\nsecurities. Negative changes in the ratings assigned to us or our debt securities could have an adverse\neffect on the market prices of the New Notes. 14\n\nUSE OF PROCEEDS\n\nWe will not receive any cash proceeds from the issuance of the New Notes in the Exchange Offers. The\nExisting Notes that are surrendered in exchange for\nthe New Notes will be retired and cancelled and cannot be reissued.\n\n15\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE EXCHANGE OFFERS Terms of the Exchange Offers We are offering to holders, upon the\nterms and subject to the conditions set forth in this prospectus, consideration consisting of up to\n$6,250,000,000 aggregate principal amount of our New 2050 Notes (the \x93New 2050 Notes Issue Cap\x94) and a\ncash payment, and up to $3,000,000,000 aggregate principal amount of our New 2060 Notes (the \x93New 2060\nNotes Issue Cap\x94 and, together with the New 2050 Notes Issue Cap, the \x93New Issue Cap\x94) and a cash\npayment, as applicable, in exchange for their Existing Notes, all as described under \x93\x97Total Exchange\nConsideration and Exchange Consideration.\x94 Holders of each series of Existing Notes accepted for exchange\nwill be eligible to receive the applicable Total Exchange Consideration as determined as described under\n\x93\x97Total Exchange Consideration and Exchange Consideration\x94 for such series of Existing Notes validly\ntendered on or before the Early Exchange Time and not validly withdrawn. The Total Exchange Consideration\nincludes the Early Exchange Premium. For Existing Notes validly tendered after the Early Exchange Time\nand on or before the Expiration Time, the holders of each series of Existing Notes accepted for exchange\nwill be eligible to receive the applicable Exchange Consideration as described under \x93\x97Total Exchange\nConsideration and Exchange Consideration.\x94 The New Notes will only be issued in minimum denominations of\n$2,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof. Tendering holders of Existing Notes must\ntender Existing Notes in minimum denominations of $2,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess\nthereof. In addition to the Total Exchange Consideration or Exchange Consideration, as applicable,\nholders with Existing Notes that are accepted for exchange will receive a cash payment representing (i)\nall or a portion of the accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the Settlement Date, and (ii)\namounts due in lieu of any fractional amounts of New Notes, in each case, as described under \x93\x97Accrued\nInterest\x94 and \x93\x97No Fractional Amounts of New Notes.\x94 As DTC is the record holder of the Existing Notes,\nall holders of any Existing Notes will also receive any applicable accrued and unpaid interest on those\nExisting Notes in accordance with DTC procedures, regardless of the record dates with respect to each\nseries of Existing Notes. We will accept valid tenders of Existing Notes by series in accordance with the\nacceptance priority levels (in numerical priority order) set forth in the applicable table on the front\ncover of this prospectus, subject to proration as discussed under \x93\x97Acceptance Priority Levels and\nProration Procedures.\x94 Total Exchange Consideration and Exchange Consideration Upon the terms and subject\nto the conditions set forth in this prospectus: If you validly tender Existing Notes prior to the Early\nExchange Time and do not validly withdraw such tendered Existing Notes prior to the Expiration Time, and\nsuch Existing Notes are accepted by us, you will receive, for each $1,000 principal amount of Existing\nNotes tendered and accepted, a combination of a principal amount of New Notes and cash with an aggregate\nvalue equal to the Total Exchange Consideration as follows:\n                                                                                                         \n       an aggregate principal amount of New Notes equal to (a)\xa0the Total Exchange Consideration for      \n  (i)  such Existing Notes                                                                               \n       minus (b)\xa0the Cash Component; and                                                                 \n                                                                                                         \n                                                     \n  (ii)  a cash payment equal to the Cash Component.  \n                                                     \n16\n\nIf you validly tender Existing Notes after the Early Exchange Time, but prior to the Expiration Time, and\nsuch Existing Notes are accepted by us, you will receive, for each $1,000 principal amount of Existing\nNotes tendered and accepted, a combination of a principal amount of New Notes and cash with an aggregate\nvalue equal to the Exchange Consideration as follows:\n                                                                                                         \n       an aggregate principal amount of New Notes equal to (a)\xa0the Total Exchange Consideration for      \n  (i)  such Existing Notes                                                                               \n       minus (b)\xa0the Cash Component minus (c)\xa0the Early Exchange Premium; and                            \n                                                                                                         \n                                                     \n  (ii)  a cash payment equal to the Cash Component.  \n                                                     \nThe Total Exchange Consideration and Exchange Consideration may be adjusted as described under\n\x93\x97Adjustment of the Total Exchange Consideration and Exchange Consideration.\x94 In addition to the Total\nExchange Consideration or Exchange Consideration, as applicable, holders with Existing Notes that are\naccepted for exchange will receive a cash payment representing (i) all or a portion of the accrued and\nunpaid interest to, but not including, the Settlement Date, and (ii) amounts due in lieu of any\nfractional amounts of New Notes, in each case, as described under \x93\x97Accrued Interest\x94 and \x93\x97No Fractional\nAmounts of New Notes.\x94 As DTC is the record holder of the Existing Notes, all holders of any Existing\nNotes will also receive any applicable accrued and unpaid interest on those Existing Notes in accordance\nwith DTC procedures, regardless of the record dates with respect to each series of Existing Notes. The\n\x93Pricing Time\x94 will be 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on May 14, 2020, unless the Early Exchange Time is\nextended, in which case a new Pricing Time may be established with respect to the Exchange Offers. In the\nevent that the Early Exchange Time is not extended, the Pricing Time will remain the same. The \x93Total\nExchange Consideration\x94 (calculated at the Pricing Time and in accordance with the formula set forth in\nAnnex A to this prospectus, as illustrated by the hypothetical pricing example included in Annex B to\nthis prospectus) for the Existing Notes validly tendered prior to the Early Exchange Time, and not\nvalidly withdrawn prior to the Expiration Time, is equal to the discounted value on the Settlement Date\nof the remaining payments of principal and interest per $1,000 principal amount of the Existing Notes\nthrough the applicable maturity date or par call date (as applicable) of the Existing Notes, using a\nyield equal to the sum of: (i) the bid-sideyield on the 30-year Reference UST Security set forth with\nrespect to each series of Existing Notes on the front cover of this prospectus plus (ii) the applicable\nfixed spread set forth with respect to each series of Existing Notes on the front cover of this\nprospectus, minus accrued and unpaid interest on such series of Existing Notes up to but not including\nthe Settlement Date. For the avoidance of doubt, the $30 per $1,000 Early Exchange Premium is included\nwithin the Total Exchange Consideration, as calculated using the Fixed Spread over the 30-year Reference\nUST Security as described herein, and is not in addition to the Total Exchange Consideration. The\n\x93Exchange Consideration\x94 for the Existing Notes validly tendered after the Early Exchange Time but prior\nto the Expiration Time is equal to the Total Exchange Consideration minus the applicable Early Exchange\nPremium. The \x93Cash Component\x94 means the portion of the Total Exchange Consideration to be paid to holders\nin cash and is equal to (i) the applicable Cash Payment Percent of Premium for such series of Existing\nNotes multiplied by (ii) (a) the applicable Total Exchange Consideration for such series of Existing\nNotes minus (b) $1,000. 17\n\nThe Dealer Managers will calculate the interest rate of the New Notes, the Total Exchange\nConsideration, the Exchange Consideration, the Cash Component and accrued interest for each of the\nExisting Notes, and their calculations will be final and binding absent manifest error. We will announce\nthe interest rate of the New Notes, the Total\nExchange Consideration, the Exchange Consideration and the Cash Component for the Existing Notes promptly\nafter they are determined by the Dealer Managers. The formula that will be used by the Dealer Managers in\nmaking the calculations of the Total\nExchange Consideration and the Exchange Consideration is attached hereto as Annex A. A hypothetical\npricing example for the calculation of the Total Exchange Consideration and the Exchange Consideration is\nattached hereto as Annex B.\n\nYou can obtain recently calculated hypothetical quotes of the yield for the 30-year Reference UST\nSecurity set forth with respect to each series of\nExisting Notes on the front cover of this prospectus, the hypothetical interest rate of the New Notes,\nthe hypothetical Total Exchange Consideration and the hypothetical Exchange Consideration for the\nExisting Notes prior to the Pricing Time, and\ncan obtain the actual yield for the 30-year Reference UST Security set forth with respect to each series\nof Existing Notes on the front cover of this prospectus, the interest rate of the New Notes, the Total\nExchange Consideration and the Exchange\nConsideration for the Existing Notes after the Pricing Time, by contacting the Dealer Managers at the\naddresses and telephone numbers set forth on the back cover of this prospectus. Although the Dealer\nManagers will calculate the Total Exchange\nConsideration and the Exchange Consideration for the Existing Notes based solely on the yield on the\n30-year Reference UST Security set forth with respect to each series of Existing Notes on the front cover\nof this prospectus, you can also find\ninformation regarding the closing yield to maturity for each 30-year Reference UST Security on any\ntrading day in the online versions of The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times.\n\nEarly Exchange Premium\n\nTo encourage holders of Existing\nNotes to tender prior to the Early Exchange Time, the Total Exchange Consideration includes an Early\nExchange Premium of $30 principal amount of New 2050 Notes or $30 principal amount of New 2060 Notes, as\napplicable, for each $1,000 principal\namount of Existing Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn. Only holders who validly tender\ntheir Existing Notes prior to the Early Exchange Time (and who do not validly withdraw prior to the\nExpiration Time), and whose tenders are accepted\nfor exchange pursuant to the Exchange Offers, will receive the Early Exchange Premium.\n\nHolders who validly tender their Existing Notes after the\nEarly Exchange Time but prior to the Expiration Time, and whose tenders are accepted for exchange, will\nreceive only the Exchange Consideration, which does not include the Early Exchange Premium.\n\nAdjustment of the Total Exchange Consideration and Exchange Consideration\n\nWe may, at our option, elect to increase or decrease the principal amount of (i) New 2050 Notes\nexchangeable for each $1,000 principal amount of the\napplicable Pool 1 Notes tendered and accepted by up to $100 per $1,000 principal amount and (ii) New 2060\nNotes exchangeable for each $1,000 principal amount of the applicable Pool 2 Notes tendered and accepted\nby up to $100 per $1,000\nprincipal amount. Such adjustments would affect the composition, but not the amount, of the Total\nExchange Consideration and the Exchange Consideration for the applicable Existing Notes. We expect any\nsuch election to be made as of the Pricing Time,\nwhich is scheduled to be the 10th business day prior to the Expiration Time.\n\n18\n\nAccrued Interest\n\nIn addition to the Total Exchange Consideration or the Exchange Consideration, as applicable, we will pay\nall of the accrued and unpaid interest to, but\nnot including, the Settlement Date on Existing Notes which are validly tendered and accepted. As DTC is\nthe record holder of the Existing Notes, all holders of any Existing Notes will also receive any\napplicable accrued and unpaid interest on those\nExisting Notes in accordance with DTC procedures, regardless of the record dates with respect to each\nseries of Existing Notes.\n\nNo Fractional Amounts of New Notes\n\nNew Notes will be issued in minimum denominations of $2,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess\nthereof. We will not accept any\ntender that would result in the issuance of less than $2,000 principal amount of New Notes. If, under the\nterms of the Exchange Offers, the aggregate principal amount of New Notes that any tendering holder is\nentitled to receive is not in a minimum\ndenomination of $2,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof, we will round downward the\namount of the New Notes to $1,000 or the nearest integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof and pay\nthe difference in cash.\n\nAcceptance Priority Levels and Proration Procedures\n\nWe will\naccept tenders of Existing Notes by series in accordance with the \x93acceptance priority level\x94 (in\nnumerical priority order) for each such series as set forth in the applicable table on the front cover of\nthis prospectus. With respect to\nExisting Notes tendered in an Exchange Offer, such Existing Notes of a series having a higher acceptance\npriority level for such Exchange Offer will be accepted for exchange before any such Existing Notes of a\nseries having a lower acceptance\npriority level.\n\nIf acceptance of all validly tendered Existing Notes of a series would result in us issuing New Notes\nhaving an aggregate principal\namount in excess of the applicable New Issue Cap, the tendered Existing Notes of such series will be\naccepted subject to proration.\n\nAny proration\nwould result in the principal amount of Existing Notes of the applicable series accepted from a holder of\nExisting Notes in exchange for New Notes to be equal to the applicable principal amount of Existing Notes\nthat would otherwise have been\naccepted from such holder (based on such holder\x92s valid tenders of the applicable series of Existing\nNotes) multiplied by the proration factor. The proration factor would be equal to the amount of the\napplicable New Issue Cap remaining\navailable for the applicable series of Existing Notes divided by the total aggregate principal amount of\nExisting Notes of the applicable series that were validly tendered. Depending on the aggregate principal\namount of Existing Notes of the\napplicable series validly tendered and not validly withdrawn and the proration factor applied, if the\nprincipal amount of Existing Notes of such series returned to a holder as a result of proration would\nresult in less than $2,000 of principal\namount of Existing Notes of such series being returned to such holder, the Company will either accept or\nreject all of such holder\x92s Existing Notes of such series validly tendered and not validly withdrawn. The\nproration factor will be\nannounced by press release as promptly as practicable after the Expiration Time. Existing Notes not\naccepted due to their acceptance priority level or the above proration procedures will be returned to\ntheir tendering holders promptly after the\nExpiration Time.\n\n19\n\nExpiration Time; Extensions; Amendments; Termination For purposes of the Exchange Offers, the term\n\x93Expiration Time\x94 means 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on May 28, 2020, subject to our right to extend\nthat time and date in our absolute discretion, in which case the Expiration Time means the latest time\nand date to which an Exchange Offer is extended. Subject to applicable law, we reserve the right, in our\nabsolute discretion, by giving oral or written notice to the Exchange Agent, to:\n                                 \n      extend an Exchange Offer;  \n                                 \n                                                                                                         \n      terminate an Exchange Offer, including in those situations in which a condition to our obligation  \n      to exchange the series of                                                                          \n      Existing Notes subject to such Exchange Offer for New Notes and cash is not satisfied or waived    \n      on or before the Expiration Time; and                                                              \n                                                                                                         \n                                \n      amend an Exchange Offer.  \n                                \nIf an Exchange Offer is amended in a manner that we determine constitutes a material change, we will\nextend such Exchange Offer for a period of two to ten business days, depending upon the significance of\nthe amendment and the manner of disclosure to the holders, if such Exchange Offer would otherwise have\nexpired during that two-to-tenbusiness day period. If any Exchange Offer is extended with respect to any\nseries of Existing Notes, we will also extend any Exchange Offers for all series having a lower\nacceptance priority level to such \x93new\x94 Expiration Time. Any increase in the consideration offered to\nholders of a series of Existing Notes pursuant to the Exchange Offers will be paid to all holders whose\nExisting Notes of such series have been previously tendered and not validly withdrawn. In addition, if we\nextend the Early Exchange Time, we may in our discretion extend it with respect to only one or more\nExchange Offers or series of Existing Notes and not all. We will promptly announce any extension,\namendment or termination of an Exchange Offer by issuing a press release. We will announce any extension\nof the Pricing Time and/or Expiration Time no later than 9:00 a.m., New York City time, on the first\nbusiness day after the previously scheduled Pricing Time and/or Expiration Time, as applicable. We have\nno other obligation to publish, advertise or otherwise communicate any information about any extension,\namendment or termination. Settlement Date We will deliver the New Notes and pay cash amounts with respect\nto the Exchange Offers on the Settlement Date. The \x93Settlement Date\x94 will promptly follow the Expiration\nTime and is expected to be June 1, 2020, which is the second business day following the Expiration Time.\nWe will not be obligated to deliver New Notes or pay any cash amounts unless the Exchange Offers are\nconsummated. Conditions to the Exchange Offers Notwithstanding any other provisions of the Exchange\nOffers, or any extension of the Exchange Offers, we will not be required to accept any Existing Notes for\nexchange, exchange any New Notes for Existing Notes or pay any cash amounts, and we may terminate any\nExchange Offer or, at our option, modify, extend or otherwise amend an Exchange Offer if any of the\nfollowing conditions have not been satisfied or waived on or before the Expiration Time (unless stated\notherwise): 1. the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part having been declared\neffective by the SEC on or prior to the Expiration Time and remaining effective on the Settlement Date;\n20\n\n2. as of the Pricing Time, the combination of the yield of the New Notes and\nthe Total Exchange Consideration or Exchange Consideration for the applicable series of Existing Notes\nwould result in the New Notes and such Existing Notes not being treated as \x93substantially different\x94\nunder ASC 470-50 (the \x93Accounting Treatment Condition\x94);\n\n3. we issue at least (a)\n$500,000,000 aggregate principal amount of New 2050 Notes and (b) $500,000,000 aggregate principal amount\nof New 2060 Notes;\n\n4. the Yield Condition (for any applicable series of Existing Notes);\n\n5. no action or event shall have occurred, been threatened, no action shall have been taken, and no\nstatute, rule, regulation,\njudgment, order, stay, decree, injunction or regulatory comments shall have been issued, promulgated,\nenacted, entered, enforced or deemed to be applicable to such Exchange Offer or the exchange of Existing\nNotes for New Notes under such Exchange\nOffer by or before any court or governmental regulatory or administrative agency, authority,\ninstrumentality or tribunal, including, without limitation, taxing authorities, that either:\n\n(a) challenges the making of such Exchange Offer or the exchange of Existing Notes for New Notes and cash\nunder\nsuch Exchange Offer or might, directly or indirectly, be reasonably expected to prohibit, prevent,\nrestrict or delay the scheduled Pricing Time or the consummation of, or might otherwise adversely affect\nin any manner, such Pricing Time, Exchange\nOffer or the exchange of Existing Notes for New Notes and cash under such Exchange Offer;

The terms of any such purchases or offers could differ from the\nterms of the Exchange Offers. Any purchase or offer to purchase will be made in accordance with\napplicable law. Certain Consequences to Holders of Existing Notes Not Tendering in the Exchange Offers\nThe following considerations, in addition to the other information described elsewhere herein or\nincorporated by reference herein, should be carefully considered by each holder of Existing Notes before\ndeciding whether to tender Existing Notes pursuant to the Exchange Offers. Limited Trading Market\nConsummation of an Exchange Offer may have adverse consequences to holders of Existing Notes that are\nsubject to such Exchange Offer who elect not to tender their Existing Notes in such Exchange Offer. In\nparticular, the trading market for such Existing Notes that are not exchanged could become more limited\nthan the existing trading market for such Existing Notes and could cease to exist altogether due to the\nreduction in the amount of such Existing Notes outstanding upon consummation of such Exchange Offer.\nBecause of the acceptance priority levels, it is more likely that a reduction in the principal amount\noutstanding could occur with respect to a series of Existing Notes having a higher priority acceptance\nlevel. A more limited trading market for a particular series of Existing Notes might adversely affect the\nliquidity, market price and price volatility of such series of Existing Notes. Treatment of Existing\nNotes Not Tendered in the Exchange Offers Existing Notes not tendered and purchased in the Exchange\nOffers will remain outstanding. The terms and conditions governing the Existing Notes, will remain\nunchanged. No amendments to the indenture governing the Existing Notes are being sought. From time to\ntime in the future, we or our subsidiaries may acquire Existing Notes that are not tendered in the\nExchange Offers through open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, tender offers, exchange\noffers or otherwise, upon such terms and at such prices as we or they may determine, which may be more or\nless than the price to be paid pursuant to the Exchange Offers and could be for cash or other\nconsideration. Alternatively, we may repurchase any or all of the Existing Notes not purchased pursuant\nto the Exchange Offers at any time. We cannot assure you as to which, if any, of these alternatives (or\ncombinations thereof) we or our subsidiaries may choose to pursue in the future. 23\n\nEffect of Tender\n\nAny tender by a holder, and our subsequent acceptance of that tender, of Existing Notes will constitute a\nbinding agreement between that holder and us\nupon the terms and subject to the conditions of the applicable Exchange Offer described in this\nprospectus. The participation in an Exchange Offer by a tendering holder will constitute the agreement by\nthat holder to deliver good and marketable\ntitle to the tendered Existing Notes, free and clear of any and all liens, restrictions, charges,\npledges, security interests, encumbrances or rights of any kind of third parties.\n\nRepresentations, Warranties and Covenants of Holders of Existing Notes\n\nBy tendering Existing Notes through the submission of an electronic acceptance instruction in accordance\nwith the requirements of ATOP, each holder of\nExisting Notes, or the beneficial holder of Existing Notes on behalf of which the holder has tendered,\nwill, subject to that holder\x92s ability to withdraw its tender, and subject to the terms and conditions of\nthe applicable Exchange Offer\ngenerally, be deemed to represent, warrant, agree and undertake to:\n\n1. irrevocably sell, assign and transfer to or upon our\norder or the order of our nominee all right, title and interest in and to, and any and all claims in\nrespect of or arising or having arisen as a result of the holder\x92s status as a holder of, all Existing\nNotes tendered thereby, such that\nthereafter the holder shall have no contractual or other rights or claims in law or equity against us or\nany fiduciary, trustee, fiscal agent or other person connected with the Existing Notes arising under,\nfrom or in connection with those Existing\nNotes;\n\n2. waive any and all rights with respect to the Existing Notes tendered thereby, including, without\nlimitation, any\nexisting or past defaults and their consequences in respect of those Existing Notes; and\n\n3. release and discharge us and the\ntrustee with respect to the indenture for the Existing Notes from any and all claims that the holder may\nhave, now or in the future, arising out of or related to the Existing Notes tendered thereby, including,\nwithout limitation, any claims that the\nholder is entitled to receive additional principal or interest payments with respect to the Existing\nNotes tendered thereby, other than accrued and unpaid interest on the Existing Notes or as otherwise\nexpressly provided in this prospectus, or to\nparticipate in any redemption or defeasance of the Existing Notes tendered thereby.\n\nIn addition, for each holder of Existing Notes tendered in an\nExchange Offer, the submission of an electronic acceptance instruction in accordance with the\nrequirements of ATOP will be deemed to represent, warrant and agree that:\n\n1. it has received this prospectus;\n\n2. it is the beneficial owner (as defined below) of, or a duly authorized representative of one or more\nbeneficial owners of, the\nExisting Notes tendered thereby, and it has full power and authority to tender, sell, assign and transfer\nthe Existing Notes tendered thereby;\n\n3. the Existing Notes being tendered thereby were owned as of the date of tender, free and clear of any\nliens, charges, claims,\nencumbrances, interests and restrictions of any kind, and we will acquire good, indefeasible and\nunencumbered title to those Existing Notes, free and clear of all liens, charges, claims, encumbrances,\ninterests and restrictions of any kind, when we\naccept the same;\n\n4. it will not sell, pledge, hypothecate or otherwise encumber or transfer any Existing Notes tendered\nthereby from the date of tender, and any purported sale, pledge, hypothecation or other encumbrance or\ntransfer will be void and of no effect;\n\n24\n\n5. it is not from or located in any jurisdiction where the making or acceptance\nof the Exchange Offers does not comply with the laws of that jurisdiction and is otherwise a person to\nwhom it is lawful to make available this prospectus or to make the applicable Exchange Offer in\naccordance with applicable laws;\n\n6. it is not resident and/or located in the United Kingdom or, if resident and/or located in the United\nKingdom, it is:\n(a) a person falling within the definition of investment professionals as defined in Article 19(5) of the\nFinancial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Financial Promotion) Order 2005, as amended (the \x93Order\x94); (b) a\nperson falling within\nArticle 43(2) or Articles 49(2)(a) to (d) of the Order; or (c) a person to whom this confidential\noffering memorandum and other documents or materials relating to the New Notes may otherwise lawfully be\ncommunicated in accordance with the\nOrder;\n\n7. the New Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and are not being\noffered, sold\nor otherwise made available to any retail investor in the European Economic Area or in the United\nKingdom. For these purposes, a \x93retail investor\x94 means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail\nclient as defined in point (11) of\nArticle 4(1) of the EU Directive on Markets in Financial Instruments (2014/65/EU) (as amended, \x93MiFID\nII\x94); (ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive (EU) 2016/97 (the \x93Insurance Distribution\nDirective\x94), where that\ncustomer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II\nor (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 (as amended, the \x93Prospectus\nRegulation\x94). Consequently, no\nkey information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as amended, the \x93PRIIPs Regulation\x94)\nfor offering or selling the New Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA\nor in the United Kingdom has\nbeen prepared and therefore offering or selling the New Notes or otherwise making them available to any\nretail investor in the EEA or in the United Kingdom may be unlawful. This prospectus has been prepared on\nthe basis that any offer of New Notes\nin any Member State of the European Economic Area will be made pursuant to an exemption under the\nProspectus Regulation from the requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of notes. This prospectus\nis not a prospectus for the purposes of the\nProspectus Regulation;\n\n8. if it is, located or resident, in Canada, such holder is an accredited investor, as defined in\nNational Instrument 45-106 Prospectus Exemptionsor subsection 73.3(1) of the Securities Act(Ontario), and\nis a permitted client as defined in National Instrument 31-103 Registration Requirements, Exemptions and\nOngoing Registrant Obligations, and such holder has completed, signed and submitted, or shall forthwith\ncomplete, sign and submit, a Canadian Eligibility Form in the form approved by the Company and in\naccordance with the procedures established by the\nCompany;\n\n9. in evaluating the applicable Exchange Offer and in making its decision whether to participate in such\nExchange\nOffer by the tender of Existing Notes, it has made its own independent appraisal of the matters referred\nto in this prospectus and in any related communications;\n\n10. the tender of Existing Notes shall constitute an undertaking to execute any further documents and\ngive any further assurances\nthat may be required in connection with any of the foregoing, in each case on and subject to the terms\nand conditions described or referred to in this prospectus;\n\n11. the submission of an electronic acceptance instruction in accordance with the requirements of ATOP\nshall, subject to a\nholder\x92s ability to withdraw its tender on or prior to the Expiration Time, and subject to the terms and\nconditions of the applicable Exchange Offer, constitute the irrevocable appointment of the Exchange Agent\nas its attorney and agent and an\nirrevocable instruction to that attorney and agent to complete and execute all or any forms of transfer\nand other documents at the discretion of that attorney and agent in relation to the Existing Notes\ntendered thereby in favor of us or any other\nperson or persons as we may direct and to deliver those forms of transfer and other documents in the\nattorney\x92s and agent\x92s discretion and the certificates and other documents of title\n\n25\n\nrelating to the registration of Existing Notes and to execute all other documents and to do all other\nacts and things as may be in the opinion of that attorney or agent necessary or expedient for\nthe purpose of, or in connection with, the acceptance of such Exchange Offer, and to vest in us or our\nnominees those Existing Notes;\n\n12. it has a net long position in the Existing Notes being tendered pursuant to the applicable Exchange\nOffer within the meaning\nof Rule 14e-4 under the Exchange Act, and the tender of such Existing Notes complies with Rule 14e-4;\n\n13. it understands that tenders with respect to a series of Existing Notes may be withdrawn by written\nnotice of withdrawal or a\nproperly transmitted \x93Request Message\x94 through ATOP received by the Exchange Agent at any time on or\nprior to the Expiration Time. In the event of a termination of the Exchange Offer with respect to such\nseries of Existing Notes, the\nExisting Notes tendered pursuant to such Exchange Offer will be credited to the account maintained at DTC\nfrom which such Existing Notes were delivered;\n\n14. it understands that tenders of Existing Notes pursuant to any of the procedures described in this\nprospectus and acceptance\nof such Existing Notes by the Company will constitute a binding agreement between holders and the Company\nupon the terms and subject to the conditions of the Exchange Offers.

If any interest payment date falls on a day that is\nnot a business day, the interest payment will\nbe made on the next succeeding business day, and we will not be liable for any additional interest as a\nresult of the delay in payment. If a maturity date falls on a day that is not a business day, the related\npayment of principal and interest will\nbe made on the next succeeding business day, and no interest will accrue on the amounts so payable for\nthe period from and after such date to the next succeeding business day. The term \x93business day\x94 means\nany day, other than a Saturday or\na Sunday, that is not a day on which banking institutions are authorized or obligated by law or executive\norder to close in New York City.\n\nOptional Redemption\n\nAt any time prior to December 1, 2049 (in the case of the New 2050 Notes) and December 1, 2059 (in the\ncase of the New 2060 Notes), we\nwill have the right at our option to redeem the New Notes of such series, in whole or in part, at any\ntime or from time to time, on at least 10 days\x92 but not more than 60 days\x92 prior notice mailed to the\nregistered address of each holder\nof the New Notes of such series to be redeemed, at a redemption price, calculated by us, equal to the\ngreater of (1) 100% of the principal amount of the New Notes of such series to be redeemed and (2) the\nsum of the present values of each\nremaining scheduled payment of principal and interest on New Notes of such series to be redeemed\n(assuming for such purposes the New 2050 Notes and the New 2060 Notes mature on December 1, 2049 and\nDecember 1, 2059, respectively) (exclusive of\ninterest accrued to the date of redemption) discounted to the redemption date on a semiannual (assuming a\n360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) basis at the\napplicable Treasury Rate plus 20 basis points (in the case of the New 2050 Notes) and 25 basis points (in\nthe case of the New 2060 Notes).\n\nAt any\ntime on or after December 1, 2049 (in the case of the New 2050 Notes) and December 1, 2059 (in the case\nof the New 2060 Notes), we will have the right at our option to redeem the New Notes of such series, in\nwhole or in part, on at least\n10 days\x92 but not more than 60 days\x92 prior notice at any time at a redemption price equal to 100% of the\nprincipal amount of the New Notes of such series to be redeemed.\n\nThe redemption price for the New Notes will include, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest on the\nprincipal amount of the New Notes to be redeemed\nto the redemption date.\n\n33\n\n\x93Comparable Treasury Issue\x94 means the United States Treasury security or securities selected by an\nIndependent Investment Banker as having an actual or interpolated maturity comparable to the remaining\nterm of the series of New Notes to be redeemed that would be utilized, at the time of selection and in\naccordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of a\ncomparable maturity to the remaining term of the New Notes of such series (assuming for such purposes the\nNew 2050 Notes and the New 2060 Notes mature on December 1, 2049 and December 1, 2059, respectively).\n\x93Comparable Treasury Price\x94 means, with respect to any redemption date (1) the arithmetic average of the\nReference Treasury Dealer Quotations for such redemption date, after excluding the highest and lowest\nsuch Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations or (2) if we obtain fewer than four such Reference Treasury\nDealer Quotations, the arithmetic average of all such quotations for such redemption date. \x93Independent\nInvestment Banker\x94 means one of the Reference Treasury Dealers appointed by us. \x93Reference Treasury\nDealer\x94 means BofA Securities, Inc. and Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. or their respective affiliates,\nwhich are primary U.S. government securities dealers in the United States of America and their respective\nsuccessors plus two other primary U.S. government securities dealers in the United States of America\ndesignated by us; provided, however, that if any of the foregoing ceases to be a primary U.S. government\nsecurities dealer in the United States of America (a \x93Primary Treasury Dealer\x94), we will substitute\ntherefor another Primary Treasury Dealer. \x93Reference Treasury Dealer Quotation\x94 means, with respect to\neach Reference Treasury Dealer and any redemption date, the arithmetic average, as determined by us, of\nthe bid and asked prices for the applicable Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a\npercentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to us by such Reference Treasury Dealer at 3:30\np.m. (New York City time) on the third business day preceding such redemption date. \x93Treasury Rate\x94\nmeans, with respect to any redemption date, the rate per annum equal to the semiannual equivalent yield\nto maturity or interpolated maturity (on a day count basis) of the applicable Comparable Treasury Issue,\nassuming a price for such Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount)\nequal to the applicable Comparable Treasury Price for such redemption date. On and after a redemption\ndate, interest will cease to accrue on the New Notes called for redemption or any portion of any series\nof the notes called for redemption (unless we default in the payment of the redemption price and accrued\nand unpaid interest). On or before the redemption date, we will deposit with the trustee money sufficient\nto pay the redemption price of and (unless the redemption date shall be an interest payment date) accrued\nand unpaid interest to the redemption date on the New Notes of such series to be redeemed on such date.\nIf less than all of the New Notes of a series are to be redeemed, the New Notes of such series to be\nredeemed will be selected by the trustee by such method as the trustee will deem fair and appropriate;\nprovided, however, that no New Notes of a principal amount of $2,000 or less shall be redeemed in part.\nCovenants The Indenture sets forth limited covenants, including the covenant described below, that will\napply to each series of New Notes. However, these covenants do not, among other things:\n                                                                                                         \n      limit the amount of indebtedness or lease obligations that may be incurred by us and our           \n      subsidiaries;                                                                                      \n                                                                                                         \n                                                                                                         \n      limit our ability or that of our subsidiaries to issue, assume or guarantee debt secured by        \n      liens; or                                                                                          \n                                                                                                         \n34\n                                                                                                         \n      restrict us from paying dividends or making distributions on our capital stock or purchasing or    \n      redeeming our capital                                                                              \n      stock.                                                                                             \n                                                                                                         \nConsolidation, Merger and Sale of Assets The Indenture provides that we may consolidate with or merge\nwith or into any other person, and may sell, transfer, or lease or convey all or substantially all of our\nproperties and assets to another person; provided that the following conditions are satisfied:\n                                                                                                         \n      we are the continuing entity, or the resulting, surviving or transferee person (the \x93Successor\x94) is  \n      a person                                                                                           \n      organized and existing under the laws of the United States of America, any state thereof or the    \n      District of Columbia and the Successor (if not us) will expressly assume, by supplemental          \n      indenture, all of our obligations under the New Notes and the                                      \n      Indenture;                                                                                         \n                                                                                                         \n                                                                                                         \n      immediately after giving effect to such transaction, no default or event of default under the      \n      Indenture has occurred and is                                                                      \n      continuing; and                                                                                    \n                                                                                                         \n                                                                                                         \n      if requested, the trustee receives from us, an officers\x92 certificate and an opinion of counsel      \n      that the merger,                                                                                   \n      consolidation or transfer and such supplemental indenture, as the case may be, complies with the   \n      applicable provisions of the Indenture.                                                            \n                                                                                                         \nIf we consolidate or merge with or into any other person or sell, transfer, lease or convey all or\nsubstantially all of our properties and assets in accordance with the Indenture, the Successor will be\nsubstituted for us in the Indenture, with the same effect as if it had been an original party to the\nIndenture. As a result, the Successor may exercise our rights and powers under the Indenture, and we will\nbe released from all our liabilities and obligations under the Indenture and under the New Notes. Any\nsubstitution of the Successor for us might be deemed for federal income tax purposes to be an exchange of\nthe New Notes for \x93new\x94 New Notes, resulting in recognition of gain or loss for such purposes and\npossibly certain other adverse tax consequences to beneficial owners of the New Notes. Holders should\nconsult their own tax advisors regarding the tax consequences of any such substitution. For purposes of\nthis covenant, \x93person\x94 means any individual, corporation, partnership, limited liability company, joint\nventure, association, joint-stock company, trust, unincorporated organization or government or any agency\nor political subdivision thereof or any other entity. Events of Default Each of the following events are\ndefined in the Indenture as an \x93event of default\x94 (whatever the reason for such event of default and\nwhether or not it will be voluntary or involuntary or be effected by operation of law or pursuant to any\njudgment, decree or order of any court or any order, rule or regulation of any administrative or\ngovernmental body) with respect to the New Notes: (1) default in the payment of any installment of\ninterest on the New Notes for 30 days after becoming due; (2) default in the payment of principal of or\npremium, if any, on the New Notes when it becomes due and payable at its stated maturity, upon optional\nredemption, upon declaration or otherwise; (3) default in the deposit of any sinking fund payment, when\nand as due by the terms of the New Notes; (4) default in the performance, or breach, of any covenant or\nagreement of ours in the Indenture with respect to the New Notes (other than as referred to in clause\n(1), (2) or (3) above), which continues for a period of 90 days after written notice to us by the trustee\nor to us and the trustee by the holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding\nNew Notes; 35\n\n(5) we pursuant to or within the meaning of the Bankruptcy Law:\n                                                \n      commence a voluntary case or proceeding;  \n                                                \n                                                                                                    \n      consent to the entry of an order for relief against us in an involuntary case or proceeding;  \n                                                                                                    \n                                                                                                        \n      consent to the appointment of a Custodian of us or for all or substantially all of our property;  \n                                                                                                        \n                                                                   \n      make a general assignment for the benefit of our creditors;  \n                                                                   \n                                                                                            \n      file a petition in bankruptcy or answer or consent seeking reorganization or relief;  \n                                                                                            \n                                                                                                         \n      consent to the filing of such petition or the appointment of or taking possession by a Custodian;  \n      or                                                                                                 \n                                                                                                         \n                                                                                    \n      take any comparable action under any foreign laws relating to insolvency; or  \n                                                                                    \n(6) a court of competent jurisdiction enters an order or decree under any Bankruptcy Law that:\n                                                                                                 \n      is for relief against us in an involuntary case, or adjudicates us insolvent or bankrupt;  \n                                                                                                 \n                                                                                      \n      appoints a Custodian of us or for all or substantially all of our property; or  \n                                                                                      \n                                                                                          \n      orders the winding-up or liquidation of us (or any similar relief is granted under  \n      any foreign laws);                                                                  \n                                                                                          \nand the order or decree remains unstayed and in effect for 90 days. \x93Bankruptcy Law\x94 means Title 11,\nUnited States Code or any similar federal or state or foreign law for the relief of debtors. \x93Custodian\x94\nmeans any custodian, receiver, trustee, assignee, liquidator or other similar official under any\nBankruptcy Law. If an event of default with respect to the New Notes (other than an event of default\nrelating to certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency, or reorganization of us) occurs and is continuing,\nthe trustee by notice to us, or the holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the\noutstanding New Notes by notice to us and the trustee, may, and the trustee at the request of these\nholders will, declare the principal of and premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest on all the\nNew Notes to be due and payable. Upon such a declaration, such principal, premium and accrued and unpaid\ninterest will be due and payable immediately. If an event of default relating to certain events of\nbankruptcy, insolvency, or reorganization of us occurs and is continuing, the principal of and premium,\nif any, and accrued and unpaid interest on the New Notes will become and be immediately due and payable\nwithout any declaration or other act on the part of the trustee or any holders. The holders of not less\nthan a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding New Notes may rescind a declaration of\nacceleration and its consequences, if we have deposited certain sums with the trustee and all events of\ndefault with respect to the New Notes, other than the non-paymentof the principal or interest which have\nbecome due solely by such acceleration, have been cured or waived, as provided in the Indenture. An event\nof default for a particular series of debt securities does not necessarily constitute an event of default\nfor any other series of debt securities issued under the Indenture. We are required to furnish the\ntrustee annually a statement by certain of our officers to the effect that, to the best of their\nknowledge, we are not in default in the fulfillment of any of our obligations under the Indenture or, if\nthere has been a default in the fulfillment of any such obligation, specifying each such default. 36\n\nNo holder of any debt securities of any series will have any right to institute any judicial or other\nproceeding with respect to the Indenture, or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee, or for any\nother remedy unless: (1) an event of default has occurred and is continuing and such holder has given the\ntrustee prior written notice of such continuing event of default with respect to the New Notes; (2) the\nholders of not less than 25% of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding New Notes have\nrequested the trustee to institute proceedings in respect of such event of default; (3) the trustee has\nbeen offered indemnity reasonably satisfactory to it against its costs, expenses and liabilities in\ncomplying with such request; (4) the trustee has failed to institute proceedings 60 days after the\nreceipt of such notice, request and offer of indemnity; and (5) no direction inconsistent with such\nwritten request has been given for 60 days by the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of\nthe outstanding New Notes. The holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of outstanding New\nNotes will have the right, subject to certain limitations, to direct the time, method and place of\nconducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the trustee with respect to the debt securities of\nthat series or exercising any trust or power conferred to the trustee, and to waive certain defaults. The\nIndenture provides that if an event of default occurs and is continuing, the trustee will exercise such\nof its rights and powers under the Indenture, and use the same degree of care and skill in their\nexercise, as a prudent person would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of such\nperson\x92s own affairs. Subject to such provisions, the trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any\nof its rights or powers under the Indenture at the request of any of the holders of the debt securities\nof a series unless they will have offered to the trustee security or indemnity satisfactory to the\ntrustee against the costs, expenses and liabilities which might be incurred by it in compliance with such\nrequest. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the holder of the New Notes will have an absolute and\nunconditional right to receive payment of the principal of and premium, if any, and interest on the New\nNotes and to institute suit for the enforcement of payment.

Each global\nsecurity will be issued to DTC, which will keep a computerized record of its participants whose clients\nhave purchased and beneficially own New Notes of a particular series. Each participant will then keep a\nrecord of its clients who have purchased\nand beneficially own New Notes of a particular series. Unless it is exchanged in whole or in part for a\ncertificated security, a global security may not be transferred. DTC, its nominee and their successors\nmay, however, transfer a global security\nas a whole to one another, and these transfers are required to be recorded on our records or a register\nto be maintained by the trustee.\n\nDTC has\nadvised us as follows: DTC is a limited-purpose trust company organized under New York Banking Law, a\n\x93banking organization\x94 within the meaning of the New York Banking Law, a member of the Federal Reserve\nSystem, a \x93clearing\ncorporation\x94 within the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code and a \x93clearing agency\x94\nregistered pursuant to the provisions of Section 17A of the Exchange Act. DTC was created to hold\nsecurities of institutions that\nhave accounts with DTC (\x93participants\x94) and to facilitate the clearance and settlement of securities\ntransactions among its participants in such securities through electronic book-entry changes in accounts\nof the participants, thereby\neliminating the need for physical movement of securities certificates. DTC\x92s participants include both\nU.S. and non-U.S. securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, clearing corporations and\ncertain other organizations. Access to DTC\x92s book-entry system is also available to others such as both\nU.S. and non-U.S. securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies and clearing corporations\nthat clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a participant, whether directly or\nindirectly.\n\n39\n\nOwnership of Beneficial Interests\n\nUpon the issuance of each global security, DTC will credit, on its book-entry registration and transfer\nsystem, the respective principal amount of the\nindividual beneficial interests represented by the global security to the accounts of participants.\nOwnership of beneficial interests in each global security will be limited to participants or persons that\nmay hold interests through participants.\nBeneficial interests in a global security will be shown on, and transfers of beneficial interests in the\nglobal securities will be made only through, records maintained by DTC and its participants. When you\npurchase notes through the DTC system, the\npurchases must be made by or through a direct participant, which will receive credit for the notes on\nDTC\x92s records. When you actually purchase the New Notes, you will become its beneficial owner. Your\nownership interest will be recorded only\non the direct or indirect participants\x92 records. DTC will have no knowledge of your individual ownership\nof the notes. DTC\x92s records will show only the identity of the direct participants and the amount of the\nnotes held by or through\nthem. You will not receive a written confirmation of your purchase or sale or any periodic account\nstatement directly from DTC. You should instead receive these from your direct or indirect participant.\nAs a result, the direct or indirect\nparticipants are responsible for keeping accurate account of the holdings of their customers.\n\nSo long as DTC or its nominee is the registered\nholder and owner of a global security, DTC or such nominee, as the case may be, will be considered the\nsole legal owner of the New Notes represented by the global security for all purposes under the\nIndenture, the New Notes and applicable law.\nExcept as set forth below, owners of beneficial interests in a global security will not be entitled to\nreceive certificated New Notes and will not be considered to be the owners or holders of any New Notes\nrepresented by the global security. We\nunderstand that under existing industry practice, in the event an owner of a beneficial interest in a\nglobal security desires to take any actions that DTC, as the holder of the global security, is entitled\nto take, DTC would authorize the\nparticipants to take such action, and that participants would authorize beneficial owners owning through\nsuch participants to take such action or would otherwise act upon the instructions of beneficial owners\nowning through them. No beneficial owner\nof an interest in a global security will be able to transfer such interest except in accordance with\nDTC\x92s applicable procedures, in addition to those provided for under the Indenture. Because DTC can only\nact on behalf of participants, who in\nturn act on behalf of others, the ability of a person having a beneficial interest in a global security\nto pledge that interest to persons that do not participate in the DTC system, or otherwise to take\nactions in respect of that interest, may be\nimpaired by the lack of a physical certificate representing that interest.\n\nAll payments on the New Notes represented by a global security\nregistered in the name of and held by DTC or its nominee will be made to DTC or its nominee, as the case\nmay be, as the registered owner and holder of the global security.\n\nThe trustee will wire payments on the New Notes to DTC\x92s nominee. The trustee and we will treat DTC\x92s\nnominee as the owner of each global\nsecurity for all purposes. Accordingly, the trustee, any paying agent and we will have no direct\nresponsibility or liability to pay amounts due on a global security to you or any other beneficial owners\nin that global security. Any redemption\nnotices will be sent by us directly to DTC, which will, in turn, inform the direct participants (or the\nindirect participants), which will then contact you as a beneficial holder.\n\nIt is DTC\x92s current practice, upon receipt of any payment of principal, interest, redemption prices,\ndistributions or liquidation amounts, to\ncredit direct participants\x92 accounts proportionately on the payment date based on their holdings. In\naddition, it is DTC\x92s current practice to pass through any consenting or voting rights to such\nparticipants by using an omnibus proxy.\nThose participants will, in turn, make payments to and solicit votes from you, the beneficial owner of\nnotes, based on their customary practices. Payments to you will be the responsibility of the participants\nand not of DTC, the trustee or our\ncompany.\n\n40\n\nUnless and until it is exchanged in whole or in part for certificated New Notes, each global security may\nnot be transferred except as a whole by DTC to a nominee of DTC or by a nominee of DTC to DTC or another\nnominee of DTC. Transfers between participants in DTC will be effected in the ordinary way in accordance\nwith DTC rules and will be settled in same-dayfunds. We expect that DTC will take any action permitted to\nbe taken by a holder of New Notes only at the direction of one or more participants to whose account the\nDTC interests in a global security are credited and only in respect of such portion of the aggregate\nprincipal amount of the New Notes as to which such participant or participants has or have given such\ndirection. However, if there is an event of default under the New Notes, DTC will exchange each global\nsecurity for certificated New Notes, which it will distribute to its participants. Although we expect\nthat DTC will agree to the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate transfers of interests in each\nglobal security among participants of DTC, DTC is under no obligation to perform or continue to perform\nsuch procedures, and such procedures may be discontinued at any time. None of we, the Dealer Managers or\nthe trustee will have any responsibility for the performance or nonperformance by DTC or its participants\nor indirect participants of their respective obligations under the rules and procedures governing their\noperations. The Indenture provides that the global securities will be exchanged for New Notes in\ncertificated form of like tenor and of an equal principal amount, in authorized denominations in the\nfollowing limited circumstances:\n                                                                                                         \n       DTC notifies us that it is unwilling or unable to continue as depository or if DTC ceases to be   \n  (i)  eligible under the                                                                                \n       Indenture and we do not appoint a successor depository within 90 days;                            \n                                                                                                         \n                                                                                                         \n        we determine that the New Notes will no longer be represented by global securities and execute   \n  (ii)  and deliver to the trustee                                                                       \n        an order to such effect; or                                                                      \n                                                                                                         \n                                                                                                  \n  (iii)  an event of default with respect to the New Notes will have occurred and be continuing.  \n                                                                                                  \nThese certificated New Notes will be registered in such name or names as DTC will instruct the trustee.\nIt is expected that such instructions may be based upon directions received by DTC from participants with\nrespect to ownership of beneficial interests in global securities. The information in this section of\nthis prospectus concerning DTC and DTC\x92s book-entry system has been obtained from sources that we believe\nto be reliable, but we do not take responsibility for this information. Euroclear and Clearstream If the\ndepositary for a global security is DTC, you may hold interests in the global security through\nClearstream Banking, société anonyme, which we refer to as \x93Clearstream,\x94 or Euroclear Bank SA/ NV, as\noperator of the Euroclear System, which we refer to as \x93Euroclear,\x94 in each case, as a participant in\nDTC. Euroclear and Clearstream will hold interests, in each case, on behalf of their participants through\ncustomers\x92 securities accounts in the names of Euroclear and Clearstream on the books of their respective\ndepositaries, which in turn will hold such interests in customers\x92 securities in the depositaries\x92 names\non DTC\x92s books. Links have been established among DTC, Clearstream and Euroclear to facilitate the\ninitial issuance of the New Notes sold outside of the United States and cross-market transfers of the\nnotes associated with secondary market trading. 41\n\nAlthough DTC, Clearstream and Euroclear have agreed to the procedures described below in order to\nfacilitate transfers, they are under no obligation to perform these procedures, and these procedures may\nbe modified or discontinued at any time.\n\nClearstream and Euroclear will record the ownership interests of their participants in much the same way\nas DTC, and DTC will record the total ownership\nof each of the U.S. agents of Clearstream and Euroclear, as participants in DTC. When New Notes are to be\ntransferred from the account of a DTC participant to the account of a Clearstream participant or a\nEuroclear participant, the purchaser must\nsend instructions to Clearstream or Euroclear through a participant at least one day prior to settlement.\nClearstream or Euroclear, as the case may be, will instruct its U.S. agent to receive New Notes against\npayment. After settlement, Clearstream\nor Euroclear will credit its participant\x92s account. Credit for the New Notes will appear on the next day\n(European time).\n\nBecause settlement\nis taking place during New York business hours, DTC participants will be able to employ their usual\nprocedures for sending New Notes to the relevant U.S. agent acting for the benefit of Clearstream or\nEuroclear participants. The sale proceeds will\nbe available to the DTC seller on the settlement date. As a result, to the DTC participant, a cross-\nmarket transaction will settle no differently than a trade between two DTC participants.\n\nWhen a Clearstream or Euroclear participant wishes to transfer New Notes to a DTC participant, the seller\nwill be required to send instructions to\nClearstream or Euroclear through a participant at least one business day prior to settlement. In these\ncases, Clearstream or Euroclear will instruct its U.S. agent to transfer these New Notes against payment\nfor them. The payment will then be\nreflected in the account of the Clearstream or Euroclear participant the following day, with the proceeds\nback-valued to the value date, which would be the preceding day, when settlement occurs in New York. If\nsettlement is not completed on the\nintended value date, that is, the trade fails, proceeds credited to the Clearstream or Euroclear\nparticipant\x92s account will instead be valued as of the actual settlement date.\n\nYou should be aware that you will only be able to make and receive deliveries, payments and other\ncommunications involving the New Notes through\nClearstream and Euroclear on the days when those clearing systems are open for business. Those systems\nmay not be open for business on days when banks, brokers and other institutions are open for business in\nthe United States. In addition, because\nof time zone differences there may be problems with completing transactions involving Clearstream and\nEuroclear on the same business day as in the United States.\n\nDischarge, Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance\n\nWe may\ndischarge certain obligations to holders of the New Notes of a series that have not already been\ndelivered to the trustee for cancellation and that either have become due and payable or will become due\nand payable within one year (or scheduled for\nredemption within one year) by depositing with the trustee, in trust, funds in U.S. dollars in an amount\nsufficient to pay the entire indebtedness including the principal and premium, if any, and interest to\nthe date of such deposit (if the New\nNotes have become due and payable) or to the maturity thereof or the redemption date of the New Notes of\nthat series, as the case may be. We may direct the trustee to invest such funds in U.S. Treasury\nsecurities with a maturity of one year or less\nor in a money market fund that invests solely in short-term U.S. Treasury securities.\n\n42\n\nThe Indenture provides that we may elect either (1) to defease and be discharged from any and all\nobligations with respect to the New Notes of a series (except for, among other things, obligations to\nregister the transfer or exchange of the New Notes, to replace temporary or mutilated, destroyed, lost or\nstolen New Notes, to maintain an office\nor agency with respect to the New Notes and to hold moneys for payment in trust) (\x93legal defeasance\x94) or\n(2) to be released from our obligations to comply with the restrictive covenants under the Indenture, and\nany omission to comply\nwith such obligations will not constitute a default or an event of default with respect to the New Notes\nof a series and clauses (4) and (7) under the heading \x93Events of Default\x94 in the Indenture will no longer\nbe applied\n(\x93covenant defeasance\x94). Legal defeasance or covenant defeasance, as the case may be, will be conditioned\nupon, among other things, the irrevocable deposit by us with the trustee, in trust, of an amount in U.S.\ndollars, or U.S. government\nobligations, or both, applicable to the New Notes of that series which through the scheduled payment of\nprincipal and interest in accordance with their terms will provide money in an amount sufficient to pay\nthe principal or premium, if any, and\ninterest on the New Notes on the scheduled due dates therefor.\n\nIf we effect covenant defeasance with respect to the New Notes of any series, the\namount in U.S. dollars, or U.S. government obligations, or both, on deposit with the trustee will be\nsufficient, in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm of independent accountants, to pay amounts due\non the New Notes of that series at the\ntime of the stated maturity but may not be sufficient to pay amounts due on the New Notes of that series\nat the time of the acceleration resulting from such event of default. However, we would remain liable to\nmake payment of such amounts due at the\ntime of acceleration.\n\nWe will be required to deliver to the trustee an opinion of counsel that the deposit and related\ndefeasance will not cause\nthe holders of the New Notes of that series to recognize gain or loss for federal income tax purposes. If\nwe elect legal defeasance, that opinion of counsel must be based upon a ruling from the U.S. Internal\nRevenue Service or a change in law to\nthat effect.\n\nWe may exercise our legal defeasance option notwithstanding our prior exercise of our covenant defeasance\noption.\n\nTrustee, Paying Agent and Security Registrar\n\nU.S. Bank\nNational Association is the trustee, paying agent and security registrar for the notes offered hereby.\nU.S. Bank National Association is a national banking association organized under and governed by the laws\nof the United States of America, and\nprovides trust services and acts as indenture trustee for numerous corporate securities issuances,\nincluding for other series of debt securities of which we are the issuer.\n\nGoverning Law\n\nThe Indenture and the New Notes will be\ngoverned by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.\n\n43\n\nCERTAIN U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS\n\nThe following discussion summarizes certain U.S. federal income tax consequences to U.S. Holders and\nNon-U.S.\nHolders (each term as defined below) of the Exchange Offers and the ownership and disposition of any New\nNotes acquired in the Exchange Offers. This summary is based upon the provisions of the U.S. Internal\nRevenue Code of 1986, as amended (the\n\x93Code\x94), proposed, temporary and final Treasury regulations promulgated under the Code, and\nadministrative rulings and judicial decisions, in each case as of the date of this prospectus. These\nauthorities are subject to differing\ninterpretations and may be changed, perhaps retroactively, resulting in U.S. federal income tax\nconsequences different from those discussed below. We have not obtained, nor do we intend to obtain, a\nruling from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the\n\x93IRS\x94) with respect to the statements made and the conclusions reached in the following summary, and\nthere can be no assurance that the IRS will agree with such statements and conclusions.\n\nThis summary assumes that the Existing Notes are, and any New Notes will be, held as capital assets\nwithin the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code\n(generally, property held for investment). This summary does not address other U.S. federal tax laws\n(such as Medicare contribution tax laws and estate and gift tax laws) or the tax considerations arising\nunder the laws of any state, local or non-U.S. jurisdiction. In addition, this summary does not address\nall tax considerations that may be applicable to a particular holder\x92s circumstances or to holders that\nmay be subject to special tax rules,\nincluding, without limitation, holders subject to the alternative minimum tax, banks, insurance companies\nor other financial institutions, regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts,\ntax-exempt organizations, dealers in securities or currencies, traders in securities that elect to use a\nmark-to-market method of\ntax accounting for their securities holdings, U.S. Holders whose \x93functional currency\x94 is not the U.S.\ndollar, controlled foreign corporations, passive foreign investment companies, U.S. expatriates,\npartnerships or other pass-through\nentities for U.S. federal income tax purposes, holders holding the Existing Notes or the New Notes as a\nposition in a hedging transaction, \x93straddle,\x94 \x93conversion transaction\x94 or other risk reduction\ntransaction, holders deemed\nto sell the Existing Notes or the New Notes under the constructive sale provisions of the Code, holders\nrequired to accelerate the recognition of any item of gross income with respect to the Existing Notes or\nthe New Notes as a result of such income\nbeing recognized on an applicable financial statement, or subsequent purchasers of the New Notes.\n\nFor purposes of this discussion, a \x93U.S.\nHolder\x94 is a beneficial owner of the Existing Notes or the New Notes that is, for U.S. federal income tax\npurposes: (i) a citizen or individual resident of the United States, (ii) a corporation, including any\nentity treated as a\ncorporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, created or organized in, or under the laws of, the\nUnited States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia, (iii) an estate the income of which is\nsubject to U.S. federal income taxation\nregardless of its source, or (iv) a trust, if its administration is subject to the primary supervision of\na U.S. court and one or more United States persons have the authority to control all substantial\ndecisions of the trust, or if it has made\na valid election under applicable Treasury regulations to be treated as a United States person.\n\nFor purposes of this discussion, a \x93Non-U.S. Holder\x94 is a beneficial owner of the Existing Notes or the\nNew Notes that is neither a U.S. Holder nor a partnership or other entity treated as a partnership for\nU.S. federal income tax purposes.\n\nIf a partnership (or other entity treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) holds\nthe Existing Notes or the New Notes, the tax\ntreatment of a partner in the partnership will depend upon the status of the partner and the activities\nof the partnership. If you are a partnership or a partner in a partnership holding the Existing Notes or\nthe New Notes, you should consult your\ntax advisor regarding the tax consequences of the Exchange Offers and the ownership and disposition of\nany New Notes acquired in the Exchange Offers.\n\n44\n\nWe believe, and the following discussion assumes, that the Existing Notes are, and the New Notes will\nbe, treated as debt for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\n\nThis summary is for general information purposes only, and is not intended to be, and\nshould not be construed to be, legal or tax advice to any particular holder. You are urged to consult\nyour tax advisor with regard to the application of the U.S. federal income tax laws, as well as the\napplication of\nnon-income tax laws and the laws of any state, local or non-U.S. taxing jurisdiction, to your particular\nsituation.\n\nTax Consequences to Exchanging U.S. Holders\n\nTax Consequences of the Exchange\n\nUnder general principles of U.S. federal income tax law, the modification of a debt instrument can give\nrise to an exchange under\nSection 1001 of the Code upon which gain or loss is realized if the modified debt instrument differs\nmaterially either in kind or in extent from the original debt instrument. In this regard, governing\nTreasury regulations (the\n\x93Modification Regulations\x94) provide that, as a general rule, an exchange occurs when, based on all the\nfacts and circumstances and taking into account all changes in the terms of the debt instrument\ncollectively (other than certain\nspecified changes), the legal rights or obligations that are altered, and the degree to which they are\naltered, are economically significant (a \x93significant modification\x94). The Modification Regulations can\napply to any modification of a\ndebt instrument, regardless of the form of the modification, including an exchange of a new debt\ninstrument for an existing debt instrument. Therefore, the Modification Regulations are relevant in\ndetermining the consequences of an exchange of\nExisting Notes for New Notes pursuant to the Exchange Offers.\n\nUnder the Modification Regulations, a change in yield of a debt instrument is a\nsignificant modification if the yield of the modified debt instrument varies from the yield on the\nunmodified instrument (determined as of the date of the modification) by more than the greater of (i) 25\nbasis points and (ii) 5 percent of the\nannual yield of the unmodified instrument. For this purpose, the yield of the modified debt instrument is\nthe annual yield of a debt instrument with (i) an issue price equal to the adjusted issue price of the\nunmodified debt instrument on the\ndate of the modification (increased by accrued but unpaid interest and decreased by payments made to the\nholder as consideration for the modification) and (ii) payments equal to the payments on the modified\ndebt instrument from the date of the\nmodification. The Modification Regulations also provide that, in general, a modification of a debt\ninstrument that results in a material deferral of scheduled payments, including an extension of the final\nmaturity date, is a significant\nmodification. However, the Modification Regulations provide that a deferral is not a material deferral if\nthe deferred payments are unconditionally payable no later than at the end of a safe harbor period which\nbegins on the original due date of the\nfirst scheduled payment that is deferred and extends for a period equal to the lesser of (i) five years\nor (ii) 50% of the original term of the debt instrument.\n\nWe intend to take the position, and the following discussion assumes, that the exchange of Existing Notes\nfor New Notes pursuant to the Exchange Offers\nwill, in each case, constitute a significant modification under the Modification Regulations. Therefore,\nyou will generally recognize gain or loss in full upon the exchange of Existing Notes for New Notes\nunless the exchange qualifies as a\nrecapitalization for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\n\n45\n\nIn order for the exchange to qualify as a recapitalization, the Existing Notes surrendered and the New\nNotes received must be treated as \x93securities\x94 under the relevant provisions of the Code. Neither the\nCode nor the Treasury regulations define the term security. Whether a debt instrument is a security is\nbased on all of the facts and\ncircumstances, but most authorities have held that the term to maturity of the debt instrument is one of\nthe most significant factors. In this regard, debt instruments with a term of ten years or more generally\nhave qualified as securities, whereas\ndebt instruments with a term of less than five years generally have not qualified as securities. Each\nseries of Existing Notes had an initial term of more than ten years and the New Notes will have a term of\nmore than ten years.Thus,\nalthough the matter is not free from doubt, we believe, and the following discussion assumes, that the\nExisting Notes and the New Notes would both be treated as securities and that the exchange of Existing\nNotes for New Notes will be treated as a\nrecapitalization for U.S. federal income tax purposes. There can be no assurance, however, that the IRS\nwill not challenge the treatment of the exchange of Existing Notes for New Notes as a recapitalization,\nand any such challenge, if successful,\nwould generally result in consequences different than those described below. You should consult your tax\nadvisor regarding the qualification of the exchange as a recapitalization for U.S. federal income tax\npurposes.\n\nUpon the exchange of Existing Notes for New Notes pursuant to the Exchange Offers, you will, subject to\nthe discussions under \x93\x97Early Exchange\nPremium\x94 and \x93\x97Cash in Lieu of Fractional New Notes,\x94 generally recognize gain (but not loss) equal to\nthe lesser of (i) the amount of any gain realized on the exchange, computed in the manner described\nbelow, and\n(ii) cash received in the exchange (other than cash paid in respect of accrued and unpaid interest on the\nExisting Notes, the treatment of which is described below under \x93\x97Accrued and Unpaid Interest\x94). The\ngain, if any, realized\non the exchange will equal the difference between (i) the sum of the \x93issue price\x94 of the New Notes\nreceived (as described below under \x93\x97Issue Price of the New Notes\x94) and the cash received (other than\ncash paid in\nrespect of accrued and unpaid interest on the Existing Notes), and (ii) your adjusted tax basis in the\nExisting Notes surrendered. Your adjusted tax basis in the Existing Notes will generally equal the amount\npaid therefor, increased by market\ndiscount, if any, previously included in income and reduced by any bond premium previously amortized.\nSubject to the discussions under \x93\x97Market Discount\x94 and \x93\x97Early Exchange Premium,\x94 any gain recognized in\nthe\nexchange will be capital gain and will be long-term capital gain if you held the Existing Notes for more\nthan one year prior to the date of the exchange. Long-term capital gains of non-corporate U.S. Holders\n(including individuals) are eligible for reduced rates of taxation. You will have an initial tax basis in\nthe New Notes equal to your adjusted tax basis in the Existing Notes surrendered in the exchange,\nincreased by any gain that you recognize in\nthe exchange, and decreased by any cash received in the exchange (other than cash paid in respect of\naccrued and unpaid interest on the Existing Notes). In addition, your holding period for the New Notes\nwill include your holding period for the\nExisting Notes surrendered in the Exchange Offers.\n\nIf you hold Existing Notes with differing tax bases and/or holding periods, the preceding rules\nmust be applied separately to each identifiable block of Existing Notes.\n\nIssue Price of the New Notes. The determination of the issue price\nof the New Notes will depend on whether the New Notes and/or the Existing Notes exchanged therefor are\n\x93publicly traded\x94 for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If the New Notes are publicly traded, they\ngenerally will have an issue price\nequal to their fair market value on the date of issuance. We expect that the New Notes will be publicly\ntraded, and, thus, that each series of New Notes will have an issue price equal to their fair market\nvalue on the date of issuance. If we\ndetermine that the New Notes are publicly traded for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we will make that\ndetermination as well as our determination of the fair market value of the New Notes available to holders\nin a commercially reasonable fashion,\nincluding by electronic publication, within 90 days of the date that the New Notes are issued.\n\n46\n\nMarket Discount. You will be considered to have acquired an Existing Note with \x93market\ndiscount\x94 if the stated principal amount of such Existing Note exceeded your initial tax basis for such\nExisting Note by more than a de minimis amount. If your Existing Notes were acquired with market\ndiscount, any gain recognized on the\nexchange of Existing Notes for New Notes will be treated as ordinary income (and will not receive capital\ngain treatment) to the extent of the market discount accrued during your period of ownership, unless you\npreviously had elected to include\nmarket discount in income as it accrued for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Any accrued market discount\non the Existing Notes that was not previously included in income (including in connection with the\nexchange) will generally carry over to the\nNew Notes. The New Notes received will also be treated as acquired with market discount (including any\naccrued market discount described above) if their stated principal amount (or their issue price if the\nNew Notes are issued with original issue\ndiscount as described below) exceeds your initial tax basis in such New Notes by more than a de minimis\namount.\n\nIf you acquired your\nExisting Notes (other than at original issuance) for a price less than their stated principal amount, you\nshould consult your tax advisor regarding the possible application of the market discount rules.\n\nEarly Exchange Premium. If you tender your Existing Notes on or before the Early Exchange Time, you will\nbe eligible to receive the Early\nExchange Premium. Although the U.S. federal income tax treatment of the receipt of the Early Exchange\nPremium is unclear, we intend to take the position, and this discussion assumes, that the Early Exchange\nPremium should be treated as additional\nconsideration received in exchange for the Existing Notes. However, the IRS could take the position that\nthe Early Exchange Premium instead should be treated as a separate fee that would be subject to tax as\nordinary income. You are urged to consult\nyour tax advisor with respect to the U.S. federal income tax treatment of the Early Exchange Premium.\n\nCash in Lieu of Fractional New Notes.\nIf you receive cash in lieu of fractional amounts of New Notes, you will generally be treated as having\nreceived fractional New Notes corresponding to such fractional amounts pursuant to the Exchange Offers\nand then as having had those fractional\nNew Notes sold for cash. As a result, you will generally recognize gain or loss on the receipt of cash in\nlieu of fractional New Notes, which gain or loss will generally be determined as described below under\n\x93\x97Tax Consequences of the\nOwnership of the New Notes\x97Sale, Exchange or Retirement of the New Notes.\x94\n\nAccrued and Unpaid Interest. Any amount received\npursuant to the Exchange Offers that is properly allocable to accrued and unpaid interest on an Existing\nNote will generally be includible in your gross income as ordinary interest income if such accrued\ninterest had not been included previously in\nyour gross income for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\n\nTax Consequences of the Ownership of the New Notes\n\nPayments of Interest. Payments of stated interest on the New Notes will be taxed to you as ordinary\nincome at the time the interest is paid or\naccrued in accordance with your method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\n\nOriginal Issue Discount. If the issue price of\nthe New Notes of a series (as described above under \x93\x97Tax Consequences of the Exchange\x97Issue Price of the\nNew Notes\x94) is less than their stated principal amount by more than a specified de minimisamount, such\nNew Notes\nwill be treated as issued with original issue discount (\x93OID\x94) in an amount equal to such difference. For\nthese purposes, the discount will be considered to exceed the de minimisthreshold if it is at least equal\nto 0.25% of the\nstated principal amount of the New Notes multiplied by the number of complete years to maturity from the\nissue date of the New Notes.\n\n47\n\nYou must generally include OID in your gross income (as ordinary income) as it accrues (on a constant\nyield to maturity basis) over the term of a New Note without regard to your regular method of accounting\nfor U.S. federal income tax purposes and in advance of the receipt of cash payments attributable to that\nincome.\n\nThe amount of OID, if any, that you must include in income with respect to a New Note will generally\nequal the sum of the \x93daily portions\x94 of\nOID with respect to the New Note for each day during the taxable year or portion of the taxable year in\nwhich you held such New Note (\x93accrued OID\x94). The daily portion is determined by allocating to each day\nin each \x93accrual\nperiod\x94 a pro rata portion of the OID allocable to that accrual period. The \x93accrual period\x94 for a New\nNote may be of any length and may vary in length over the term of the New Note, provided that each\naccrual period is no longer than\none year and each scheduled payment of principal or interest occurs on the first day or the final day of\nan accrual period. The amount of OID allocable to any accrual period other than the final accrual period\nis an amount equal to the excess, if\nany, of (i) the product of the New Note\x92s adjusted issue price at the beginning of such accrual period\nand its yield to maturity (determined on the basis of compounding at the close of each accrual period and\nproperly adjusted for the\nlength of the accrual period) over (ii) the aggregate of all stated interest allocable to the accrual\nperiod. OID allocable to a final accrual period is the difference between the amount payable at maturity\n(other than a payment of stated\ninterest) and the adjusted issue price of the New Note at the beginning of the final accrual period. The\nadjusted issue price of a New Note at the beginning of any accrual period is equal to its issue price,\nincreased by the accrued OID, if any, for\neach prior accrual period (determined without regard to the amortization of any acquisition premium or\namortizable bond premium, as discussed below). Under these rules, you generally will have to include in\nincome increasingly greater amounts of OID\nin successive accrual periods.\n\nIf your initial tax basis in a New Note is greater than its issue price and less than or equal to its\nstated\nprincipal amount, the New Note will be considered to have been issued to you at an \x93acquisition premium.\x94\nUnder the acquisition premium rules, the amount of OID that you must include in gross income with respect\nto the New Note for any\ntaxable year will be reduced by the portion of the acquisition premium properly allocable to that year.\n\nYou may elect to treat all interest\n(including stated interest, OID or de minimisOID, and market discount or de minimismarket discount, as\nadjusted by any acquisition premium or amortizable bond premium) on a New Note as OID and calculate the\namount includible in gross\nincome under the constant yield method described above. The election must be made for the taxable year in\nwhich you acquire the New Note, and may not be revoked without the consent of the IRS. You should consult\nyour tax advisor about this election.\nThis discussion assumes this election is not made.\n\nAmortizable Bond Premium. If your initial tax basis in a New Note is greater than its\nstated principal amount, you will be considered to have acquired the New Note with \x93amortizable bond\npremium\x94 and, in the case of any New Notes issued with OID, you will not be required to include any OID\nin income. You generally may elect\nto amortize the premium over the remaining term of the New Note on a constant yield method as an offset\nto interest when includible in income under your regular accounting method. However, because the New\nNotes may be redeemed by us prior to\nmaturity at a premium, special rules apply that may reduce, eliminate or defer the amount of premium that\nyou may amortize with respect to a New Note. You should consult your tax advisor about these special\nrules. If you do not elect to amortize the\npremium, that premium will decrease the gain or increase the loss you would otherwise recognize on\nmaturity or disposition of the New Note. An election to amortize premium on a constant yield method will\nalso apply to all other taxable debt\ninstruments held or subsequently acquired by you on or after the first day of the first taxable year for\nwhich the election is made. Such an election may not be revoked without the consent of the IRS. You\nshould consult your tax advisor about this\nelection.\n\n48\n\nMarket Discount. If your New Notes have market discount (see \x93\x97Tax Consequences of the Exchange\x97 Market\nDiscount\x94 above), under the market discount rules, you will be required to treat any gain on the sale,\nexchange or retirement of such New Notes as ordinary income to the extent of the market discount that is\ntreated as having accrued on such New Notes at the time of the sale, exchange or retirement, and which\nyou have not previously included in income. Any market discount will be considered to accrue ratably\nduring the period from the date of acquisition to the maturity date of the New Notes unless you elect to\naccrue on a constant interest method. You may elect to include market discount in income currently as it\naccrues, on either a ratable or constant interest method, in which case any gain recognized will not be\nrecharacterized as ordinary income. Sale, Exchange or Retirement of the New Notes. Unless a non-\nrecognitionprovision applies, you will recognize taxable gain or loss upon a sale, exchange or retirement\nof a New Note in an amount equal to the difference between (i) the amount of cash and the fair market\nvalue of any property received (less an amount equal to any accrued but unpaid stated interest, which\nwill be taxed in the manner described above under \x93\x97Payments of Interest\x94) and (ii) your adjusted tax\nbasis in the New Note. Your adjusted tax basis in a New Note will be your initial tax basis in the New\nNote, increased by any OID or market discount previously included in income, and reduced by any amortized\nbond premium. Any gain or loss on the sale, exchange or retirement of a New Note will be capital gain or\nloss (although all or a portion of any recognized gain could be subject to ordinary income treatment if\nthere is any accrued market discount on the New Note that has not been included in income at the time of\nthe sale, exchange or retirement, as discussed above under \x93\x97Market Discount\x94) and will be long-term\ncapital gain or loss if the New Note has a holding period of more than one year at the time of the sale,\nexchange or retirement. Long-term capital gains of non-corporateU.S. Holders (including individuals) are\neligible for reduced rates of taxation. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.\nTax Consequences to Exchanging Non-U.S.Holders The following discussion is a summary of certain U.S.\nfederal income tax consequences that will apply to you if you are a Non-U.S.Holder who exchanges Existing\nNotes for New Notes pursuant to the Exchange Offers.

In addition, if you are a foreign corporation, you may be subject to a branch profits\ntax equal to 30% (or lower applicable income tax treaty rate) of your effectively connected earnings and\nprofits, subject to adjustments. If you are an individual Non-U.S.Holder described in the second bullet\nabove, unless an applicable income tax treaty provides otherwise, you will generally be subject to a flat\n30% U.S. federal income tax on any gain recognized, which may be offset by certain U.S. source losses.\nAccrued and Unpaid Interest.

If any interest (including any OID) on, or gain realized upon\nthe disposition of, the New Notes is U.S. trade or business income, you will be subject to U.S. federal\nincome tax on that interest or gain on a net income basis (although you will be exempt from the 30% U.S.\nfederal withholding tax on interest, provided the certification requirements discussed above are\nsatisfied) in the same manner as if you were a U.S. Holder. In addition, if you are a foreign\ncorporation, you may be subject to an additional branch profits tax equal to 30% (or lower applicable\nincome tax treaty rate) of your effectively connected earnings and profits, subject to adjustments. 51\n\nBackup Withholding and Information Reporting\n\nU.S. Holders\n\nInformation reporting requirements will\ngenerally apply to payments of interest on the Existing Notes or the New Notes, any OID accruals on the\nNew Notes, and proceeds from a disposition (including a retirement or redemption) of the Existing Notes\nor the New Notes (unless, in each case,\nyou are an exempt recipient such as a corporation). Backup withholding may apply to any payments\ndescribed in the preceding sentence if you fail to provide a taxpayer identification number or a\ncertification that you are not subject to backup\nwithholding. Backup withholding is not an additional tax and any amounts withheld under the backup\nwithholding rules may be allowed as a refund or a credit against your U.S. federal income tax liability,\nprovided that the required information is\ntimely furnished to the IRS.\n\nNon-U.S.Holders\n\nInformation returns generally will be filed in connection with the amount of interest (including any OID)\npaid to you with respect to the Existing Notes\nor the New Notes and the amount of tax, if any, withheld with respect to such payments. Copies of the\ninformation returns reporting such interest payments and any withholding may also be made available to\nthe tax authorities in the country in which\nyou reside under the provisions of an applicable income tax treaty.\n\nIn general, you will not be subject to backup withholding with respect to\ninterest (including any OID) paid to you with respect to the Existing Notes or the New Notes, provided in\neach case that the applicable withholding agent does not have actual knowledge or reason to know that you\nare a United States person as defined\nunder the Code, and you have provided a validly completed applicable IRS Form W-8 establishing that you\nare not a United States person (or you satisfy certain documentary evidence requirements for establishing\nthat you are not a United States person).\n\nInformation reporting and, depending on the circumstances, backup withholding will apply to the proceeds\nof a sale or other disposition (including a retirement or redemption) of the Existing Notes or the New\nNotes made within the United States or conducted through certain United States-related financial\nintermediaries, unless you certify to the payor\nunder penalties of perjury that you are not a United States person as defined under the Code (and the\npayor does not have actual knowledge or reason to know that you are a United States person), or you\notherwise establish an exemption.\n\nBackup withholding is not an additional tax and any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules\nmay be allowed as a refund or a credit against\nyour U.S. federal income tax liability, provided that the required information is timely furnished to the\nIRS.\n\n52\n\nAdditional Withholding Requirements\n\nUnder Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code (such Sections commonly referred to as \x93FATCA\x94), a 30% U.S.\nfederal withholding tax may apply to\nany interest (including any OID) paid on the Existing Notes or the New Notes to (i) a \x93foreign financial\ninstitution\x94 (as specifically defined in the Code) which does not provide sufficient documentation,\ntypically on IRS Form W-8BEN-E, evidencing either (x) an exemption from FATCA, or (y) its compliance (or\ndeemed compliance) with FATCA (which may alternatively be in the form of\ncompliance with an intergovernmental agreement with the United States) in a manner which avoids\nwithholding, or (ii) a \x93non-financial foreign entity\x94 (as specifically defined in the Code) which\ndoes not provide sufficient documentation, typically on IRS Form W-8BEN-E, evidencing either (x) an\nexemption from FATCA, or (y) adequate information regarding\ncertain substantial U.S. beneficial owners of such entity (if any). If an interest payment is both\nsubject to withholding under FATCA and subject to the withholding tax discussed above under \x93\x97 Tax\nConsequences to Exchanging Non-U.S. Holders\x97Tax Consequences of the Exchange\x97Accrued and Unpaid Interest\x94\nand \x93\x97Tax Consequences to Exchanging Non-U.S. Holders\x97Tax\nConsequences of the Ownership of the New Notes\x97Payments of Interest,\x94 the withholding under FATCA may be\ncredited against, and therefore reduce, such other withholding tax.\n\nHowever, any debt instrument issued before July 1, 2014 is generally treated as a \x93grandfathered\nobligation\x94 that is exempt from FATCA\nwithholding (unless such debt instrument was the subject of a \x93significant modification\x94 after such\ndate). Accordingly, FATCA withholding is not expected to apply with respect to payments attributable to\naccrued and unpaid interest on the\n5.200% Notes due 2039, the 4.500% Notes due 2040, the 5.300% Notes due 2041, the 3.750% Notes due 2043\nand the 4.875% Notes due 2043. In addition, while withholding under FATCA would also have applied to\npayments of gross proceeds from a taxable\ndisposition of the Existing Notes or the New Notes on or after January 1, 2019, proposed U.S. Treasury\nregulations (the preamble to which indicates that taxpayers may rely on the regulations pending their\nfinalization) eliminate FATCA\nwithholding on payments of gross proceeds entirely.\n\nYou should consult your tax advisor regarding these rules and whether they may be relevant to\nthe exchange of the Existing Notes pursuant to the Exchange Offers and your ownership and disposition of\nthe New Notes.\n\nNon-ExchangingHolders\n\nIf you are a holder of Existing Notes that does not participate in the Exchange Offers, you will not\nrecognize any gain or loss in respect of the\nExchange Offers for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\n\n53\n\nNOTICES TO CERTAIN NON-U.S. HOLDERS\n\nGeneral\n\nNo action has been or will be taken in any non-U.S.\njurisdiction that would permit a public offering of the New Notes or the possession, circulation or\ndistribution of this prospectus or any material relating to us, the Existing Notes or the New Notes in\nany jurisdiction where action for that purpose\nis required.

See\n\x91\x91Description of the Exchange Offers\x97No Fractional Amounts of New Notes.\x92\x92 If, under the terms of the\nExchange Offers, the aggregate principal amount of New Notes that any tendering holder is entitled to\nreceive is not in a\nminimum denomination of $2,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof, we will round\ndownward the amount of the New Notes to $1,000 or the nearest integral multiple of $1,000 in excess\nthereof and pay the difference in cash.\n\nCanada\n\nThe New Notes may be offered or sold only to\npurchasers purchasing, or deemed to be purchasing, as principal that are accredited investors, as defined\nin National Instrument 45-106 Prospectus Exemptions or subsection 73.3(1) of the Securities Act\n(Ontario), and are permitted clients, as\ndefined in National Instrument 31-103 Registration Requirements, Exemptions and Ongoing Registrant\nObligations. Accordingly, holders of Existing Notes that are located or resident in Canada may only\nparticipate in and receive New Notes in the\nExchange Offers if they satisfy these requirements. Any resale of the New Notes must be made in\naccordance with an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the prospectus requirements of\napplicable securities laws.\n\nSecurities legislation in certain provinces or territories of Canada may provide a purchaser with\nremedies for rescission or damages if this offering\nmemorandum (including any amendment thereto) contains a misrepresentation, provided that the remedies for\nrescission or damages are exercised by the purchaser within the time limit prescribed by the securities\nlegislation of the purchaser\x92s\nprovince or territory. The purchaser should refer to any applicable provisions of the securities\nlegislation of the purchaser\x92s province or territory for particulars of these rights or consult with a\nlegal advisor.\n\n54\n\nPursuant to section 3A.3 of National Instrument 33-105 Underwriting Conflicts (NI 33-105), the\npurchasers are not required to comply with the disclosure requirements of NI 33-105 regarding underwriter\nconflicts of interest in connection with the Tender Offers and Solicitations.\n\nHolders of Existing Notes that are located or resident in Canada must complete, sign and submit a\nCanadian Eligibility Form in the form approved by the\nCompany and in accordance with the procedures established by the Company to confirm that they satisfy\napplicable Canadian securities law requirements and to provide certain additional information required\nfor them to participate in the Exchange\nOffers.\n\nEuropean Economic Area\n\nThe New Notes are\nnot intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and are not being offered, sold or\notherwise made available to any retail investor in the European Economic Area or in the United Kingdom.\nFor these purposes, a \x93retail\ninvestor\x94 means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article\n4(1) of the EU Directive on Markets in Financial Instruments (2014/65/EU) (as amended, \x93MiFID II\x94); (ii)\na customer within the\nmeaning of Directive (EU) 2016/97 (the \x93Insurance Distribution Directive\x94), where that customer would not\nqualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II or (iii) not a\nqualified investor as defined in\nRegulation (EU) 2017/1129 (as amended, the \x93Prospectus Regulation\x94).

Therefore, the New Notes have not been authorized for\ndistribution by\nFINMA as a foreign collective investment scheme pursuant to Article 119 CISA and the notes offered hereby\nmay not be offered to the public (as this term is defined in Article 3 CISA) in or from Switzerland.

Such\nfinancial statements have been so incorporated in reliance upon the reports of such firm given upon their\nauthority as experts in accounting and auditing.\n\nWith respect to the unaudited interim financial information for the periods ended March 31, 2020 and\n2019, December 31, 2019 and 2018, and\nSeptember 30, 2019 and 2018, which is incorporated herein by reference, Deloitte & Touche LLP, an\nindependent registered public accounting firm, have applied limited procedures in accordance with the\nstandards of the Public Company\nAccounting Oversight Board (United States) for a review of such information. However, as stated in their\nreports included in Microsoft Corporation\x92s Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters\nended March 31, 2020, December 31, 2019, and September 30, 2019, and incorporated by reference herein,\nthey did not audit and they do not express an opinion on that interim financial information. Accordingly,\nthe degree of reliance on\ntheir reports on such information should be restricted in light of the limited nature of the review\nprocedures applied. Deloitte & Touche LLP are not subject to the liability provisions of Section 11 of\nthe Securities Act of 1933, as\namended (the \x93Securities Act\x94), for their reports on the unaudited interim financial information because\nthose reports are not \x93reports\x94 or a \x93part\x94 of the Registration Statement prepared or certified by an\naccountant\nwithin the meaning of Sections 7 and 11 of the Securities Act.\n\n58\n\nWHERE YOU CAN FIND MORE INFORMATION\n\nWe file annual, quarterly and current reports, proxy statements and other information with the SEC.

Indemnification of Directors and Officers.\n\nSections 23B.08.510 and 23B.08.570 of the Washington Business Corporation Act (\x93WBCA\x94)\nauthorizes Washington corporations to indemnify their officers and directors under certain circumstances\nagainst expenses and liabilities incurred in legal proceedings involving them as a result of their\nservice as an officer or director.\nSection 23B.08.560 of the WBCA authorizes a corporation by provision in its articles of incorporation to\nindemnify or agree to indemnify a director made a party to a proceeding, or obligate itself to advance or\nreimburse expenses incurred in a\nproceeding, without regard to the limitations imposed by Sections 23B.08.510 through .550 of the WBCA;\nprovided, however, that no such indemnity shall be made for or on account of (a) acts or omissions of the\ndirector finally adjudged to be\nintentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law, (b) conduct of the director finally adjudged to be\nin violation of Section 23B.08.310 of the WBCA (relating to unlawful distributions) or (c) any\ntransaction with respect to which\nit was finally adjudged that the director personally received a benefit in money, property, or services\nto which the director is not legally entitled.\n\nThe Registrant\x92s Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation require indemnification of the\nRegistrant\x92s officers and directors and\nadvancement of expenses to the fullest extent not prohibited by applicable law. The Registrant\x92s Amended\nand Restated Articles of Incorporation provide for procedures for those seeking indemnification and/or\nadvancement of expenses. In\naddition, as authorized by Section 23B.08.320 of the WBCA, the Registrant\x92s Amended and Restated Articles\nof Incorporation contain a provision eliminating the personal liability of directors to the Registrant or\nits shareholders for\nmonetary damages for conduct as a director, except for (a) omissions involving intentional misconduct by\nthe director or a knowing violation of law by the director, (b) conduct violating Section 23B.08.310 of\nthe WBCA or (c) any\ntransaction from which the director will personally receive a benefit in money, property or services to\nwhich the director is not legally entitled.\n\nThe Registrant has established an indemnification trust (\x932016 Directors\x92 Trust\x94) to fund the\nRegistrant\x92s obligations to indemnify\nand/or advance expenses to directors arising from their board service in the event the Registrant does\nnot or is financially unable to provide the indemnification and/or advancement. As required by the 2016\nDirectors\x92 Trust agreement, the\nRegistrant has funded a minimum balance of principal assets of no less than $50 million in the trust. The\nRegistrant also has an indemnification trust (\x932016 Officers\x92 Trust\x94) that funds the Registrant\x92s\nindemnification\nobligations to certain past and present officers arising from their activities as such. As required by\nthe 2016 Officers\x92 Trust agreement, the Registrant has funded a minimum balance of principal assets of no\nless than $50 million in the\ntrust. The 2016 Directors\x92 Trust and 2016 Officers\x92 Trust are successors to certain trusts originally\nestablished in 1993, and amended from time to time, to fund Registrant\x92s indemnification obligations to\ndirectors and officers. The\nRegistrant has also entered into separate indemnification agreements with certain of its directors and\nexecutive officers.\n\nII-1\n\nItem 21.

Undertakings. (a) The undersigned registrant hereby undertakes: (1) to file, during any period\nin which offers or sales are being made, a post-effective amendment to this registration statement: (i)\nto include any prospectus required by section 10(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the\n\x93Securities Act\x94); (ii) to reflect in the prospectus any facts or events arising after the effective date\nof the registration statement (or the most recent post-effective amendment thereof) which, individually\nor in the aggregate, represent a fundamental change in the information set forth in the registration\nstatement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any increase or decrease in volume of securities offered (if\nthe total dollar value of securities offered would not exceed that which was registered) and any\ndeviation from the low or high end of the estimated maximum offering range may be reflected in the form\nof prospectus filed with the SEC pursuant to Rule 424(b) if, in the aggregate, the changes in volume and\nprice represent no more than 20% change in the maximum aggregate offering price set forth in the\n\x93Calculation of Registration Fee\x94 table in the effective registration statement; and (iii) to include any\nmaterial information with respect to the plan of distribution not previously disclosed in the\nregistration statement or any material change to such information in the registration statement; (2)\nthat, for the purpose of determining any liability under the Securities Act, each such post-effective\namendment shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein,\nand the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering\nthereof; (3) to remove from registration by means of a post-effective amendment any of the securities\nbeing registered which remain unsold at the termination of the offering; (4) That, for the purpose of\ndetermining liability under the Securities Act to any purchaser, if the registrants are subject to Rule\n430C, each prospectus filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) as part of a registration statement relating to an\noffering, other than registration statements relying on Rule 430B or other than prospectuses filed in\nreliance on Rule 430A, shall be deemed to be part of and included in the registration statement as of the\ndate it is first used after effectiveness.

For Great Plains\'\n     shareholders, the merger offers the opportunity to receive a premium for\n     their shares based upon the market prices of Great Plains and Microsoft\n     common stock immediately prior to the public announcement of the merger.\n     The merger also offers Great Plains\' shareholders the opportunity to\n     continue to participate in the growth of the business conducted by\n     Microsoft and Great Plains following the merger and to benefit from the\n     potential appreciation in value of Microsoft common stock.\nQ: What will I receive in the merger?\n  A: For each share of Great Plains common stock you own, you will receive 1.1\n     shares of Microsoft common stock. For example, if you own 100 shares of\n     Great Plains common stock, you will receive 110 shares of Microsoft common\n     stock. Microsoft will not issue fractional shares of its common stock.\n     Instead of any fractional shares, you will receive cash based on the\n     average market price of Microsoft common stock over a specified period of\n     time before the closing of the merger.\nQ:  Does the board of directors of Great Plains recommend voting in favor of\n    the merger agreement?\n  A: Yes. After careful consideration, Great Plains\' board of directors has\n     determined that the terms of the merger are fair to, and in the best\n     interests of, Great Plains and its shareholders and unanimously recommends\n     that you vote in favor of the merger agreement.\nQ: What vote is required to approve the merger?\n  A: The holders of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of Great\n     Plains common stock must approve the merger agreement. Microsoft\n     shareholders are not required to approve the merger and will not vote on\n     the merger.\n   You are entitled to cast one vote per share of Great Plains common stock you\n   owned at the close of business on [      ], 2001, the record date for the\n   special meeting.\n   As of the record date, the holders of approximately [22.9]% of the\n   outstanding shares of common stock have already agreed to vote in favor of\n   the merger pursuant to voting agreements entered into in connection with the\n   execution of the merger agreement. These shareholders have already given\n   irrevocable proxies to Microsoft to vote in favor of the merger.\nQ:  Are there risks I should consider in deciding whether to vote for the\n    merger?\n  A: Yes. For example, Great Plains shareholders will receive 1.1 shares of\n     Microsoft common stock for each share of Great Plains common stock they\n     own, regardless of the market price of either Microsoft common stock or\n     Great Plains common stock at the effective time of the merger. The market\n     value of Microsoft common stock is likely to fluctuate, and no one can\n     accurately predict what the market value will be either at the effective\n     time of the merger or after the merger. In evaluating the merger, you\n     should carefully consider this and other factors discussed in the section\n     entitled ""Risk Factors"" beginning on page 15.\n                                       1\n<PAGE>\nQ: What do I need to do now?\n  A: You should cast your vote on the merger agreement by completing, signing\n     and dating your proxy card. You should return your completed proxy card as\n     soon as possible in the enclosed postage-paid envelope. If you return your\n     signed proxy card but do not include instructions on how to vote, your\n     shares will be voted ""FOR"" approval of the merger agreement. Instead of\n     returning your proxy by mail, you may vote your shares through a toll-free\n     number or over the Internet. Instructions for using these convenient\n     services are provided on the enclosed proxy card. You can also attend the\n     special meeting and vote in person.\n   If you abstain from voting or do not vote, it will have the effect of voting\n   against approval of the merger agreement.\n   THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF GREAT PLAINS UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT YOU VOTE\n   ""FOR"" APPROVAL OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT.\nQ: What do I do if I want to change my vote?\n  A: At any time before your proxy is voted at the special meeting, you can\n     change your vote. First, you can send Mellon Investor Services LLC, the\n     firm that Great Plains has retained to provide proxy solicitation\n     services, a written notice stating that you would like to revoke your\n     proxy. Second, you can complete and send a later-dated signed proxy card\n     to Mellon Investor Services. Third, if you voted by telephone or over the\n     Internet, you can follow the revocation procedures provided at the time of\n     your vote on the Internet voting site or telephone voting system. Finally,\n     you can attend the special meeting and vote in person.\nQ:  If my Great Plains shares are held in ""street name"" by my broker, will my\n    broker vote my shares for me?\n  A: Your broker will vote your shares only if you provide instructions on how\n     to vote. You should fill out the voter instruction form sent to you by\n     your broker with this proxy statement/prospectus. If you do not give\n     instructions to your broker, your shares will not be voted, which will\n     have the effect of voting against the merger.\nQ: Should I send in my Great Plains stock certificates now?\n  A: No. After the merger is completed, we will send you written instructions\n     for exchanging your Great Plains stock certificates for Microsoft stock\n     certificates. Please do not send in your stock certificates with your\n     proxy card.\nQ: When do you expect the merger to be completed?\n  A: We are working toward completing the merger as quickly as possible. We\n     hope to complete the merger in the second calendar quarter of 2001, if\n     regulatory approvals and other required matters are completed at that\n     time.\nQ: Will I recognize a taxable gain or loss on the transaction?\n  A: Microsoft and Great Plains intend the merger to qualify as a tax-free\n     reorganization under the Internal Revenue Code. Accordingly, we expect\n     that if the merger is completed, Great Plains shareholders should not\n     recognize a gain or loss for United States federal income tax purposes as\n     a result of the merger, except that you will recognize a gain or loss with\n     respect to cash received instead of a fractional share or with respect to\n     cash received upon exercise of dissenters\' rights. However, we urge you to\n     consult your own tax advisor to determine the tax consequences particular\n     to your situation.\n                                       2\n<PAGE>\nQ: Will Great Plains employee stock options become Microsoft stock options?\n  A: Yes. Employee stock options to purchase shares of Great Plains common\n     stock will be assumed by Microsoft and will automatically become options\n     to purchase shares of Microsoft common stock. The number of shares subject\n     to each option and the exercise price per share will be adjusted to\n     reflect the 1.1 exchange ratio, with options for fractional shares being\n     rounded to the nearest whole Microsoft share. Vesting schedules for\n     employee options will not be affected by the merger.\nQ: Whom should I call with questions?\n  A: If you have any questions about the merger or if you need additional\n     copies of the proxy statement/prospectus, you should contact:\n      Pam Kloster\n      Investor Relations\n      Great Plains Software Inc.\n      Phone: (701) 281-6780\n      Fax: (701) 492-1018\n      Email: pam.kloster@greatplains.com\n   If you have any questions regarding Microsoft, you should contact:\n      Investor Relations\n      Microsoft Corporation\n      One Microsoft Way\n      Redmond, Washington 98052\n      Phone: (800) 285-7772\n      Fax: (425) 936-8000\n      Email: msft@microsoft.com\n   You may also obtain additional information about Microsoft and Great Plains\n   from documents we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, by\n   following the instructions in the section entitled ""Where you can find more\n   information"" on page 66.\n                                       3\n<PAGE>\n                   SUMMARY OF THIS PROXY STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS\n   This summary highlights selected information from this proxy\nstatement/prospectus and may not contain all of the information that is\nimportant to you.

Great Plains has 2,000 team members\n worldwide and has been named four times to the ""Top 100 Companies to\n Work for in America"" list.\n    On January 16, 2001, Great Plains filed its financial results for\n the second quarter of fiscal year 2001, ended November 30, 2000, with\n the SEC on Form 10-Q. Revenues for the quarter ended November 30, 2000\n were $75.5 million, a 59.5% increase over revenues for the second\n quarter of fiscal 2000 of $47.4 million. Net income (loss) for the\n second quarter of fiscal 2001 was $(10.5) million, compared to net\n income for the second quarter of fiscal 2000 of $4.4 million. Diluted\n earnings (loss) per share for the second quarter of fiscal 2001 were\n $(0.52), compared to diluted earnings per share for the second quarter\n of fiscal 2000 of $0.27. Excluding the amortization of acquired\n intangibles and the related tax effect, pro forma net income was $4.2\n million for the second quarter of fiscal 2001, compared to $4.6 million\n for the second quarter of fiscal 2000. Pro forma diluted earnings per\n share for the second quarter of fiscal 2001 were $0.20, compared to\n $0.28 for the second quarter of fiscal 2000.\n    For additional information about Great Plains\' business, see Great\n Plains\' Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31,\n 2000 and other documents Great Plains has filed with the SEC, which are\n incorporated into this proxy statement/prospectus by reference. See\n ""Where you can find more information"" on page 66. The information on\n Great Plains\' Web site is not part of this proxy statement/prospectus.\n                                       5\n<PAGE>\n                           SUMMARY OF THE TRANSACTION\nThe merger (see page 25)\n   In the merger, a wholly owned subsidiary of Microsoft will merge with and\ninto Great Plains, and Great Plains will become a wholly owned subsidiary of\nMicrosoft.\n   The merger agreement is attached to this proxy statement/prospectus as Annex\nA. We encourage you to carefully read the merger agreement and the discussion\nof the merger and merger agreement in this proxy statement/prospectus.\nGreat Plains\' reasons for the merger (see page 26)\n   In reaching its decision to approve and adopt the merger agreement and to\nunanimously recommend that Great Plains shareholders approve the merger\nagreement, Great Plains\' board of directors identified reasons why the merger\nshould be beneficial to Great Plains and its shareholders, employees, partners\nand customers. In the course of deliberations, Great Plains\' board also\nreviewed with its executive management team and its legal and financial\nadvisors a number of additional factors relevant to the merger. Great Plains\'\nboard also considered and balanced against the potential benefits of the merger\na number of potentially negative factors.\nRecommendation of Great Plains\' board of directors (see page 28)\n   After careful consideration, Great Plains\' board of directors approved the\nmerger agreement and unanimously recommends that you vote ""FOR"" approval of the\nmerger agreement.\nMerger consideration (see page 36)\n   You will be entitled to receive 1.1 shares of Microsoft common stock for\neach share of Great Plains common stock you own. Microsoft will not issue\nfractional shares of stock. You instead will receive cash for fractional shares\nbased on the average market price of Microsoft common stock over a specified\nperiod of time before the closing of the merger.\nTreatment of options (see page 37)\n   Outstanding options to purchase shares of Great Plains common stock will\nbecome options to purchase shares of Microsoft common stock on the same terms\nand conditions as the Great Plains options. Microsoft has agreed to use good\nfaith efforts to ensure that Great Plains options which qualified as ""incentive\nstock options"" as defined by the Internal Revenue Code prior to the merger will\nqualify as incentive stock options for Microsoft common stock after the merger.\nGreat Plains options that do not qualify as incentive stock options will\nconvert into options for Microsoft common stock that are similarly non-\nqualified. The number of shares subject to each option and the exercise price\nper share will be adjusted to reflect the 1.1 exchange ratio. Option vesting\nschedules and exercisability will not be affected by the merger.\nTreatment of employee stock plans and other benefit plans (see page 37)\n   Immediately before the effective time of the merger, Great Plains will\nterminate or modify according to Microsoft\'s direction all of Great Plains\'\nvarious stock option and stock purchase plans. This termination will not result\nin any loss of rights for those employees who purchased stock or have already\nbeen granted options or other awards under these plans. Microsoft has the right\nto require Great Plains to modify or terminate its other employee benefits\nplans; however it is currently anticipated that Great Plains will maintain its\nown separate non-stock based benefits plans for the immediate future without\nmodification.\n                                       6\n<PAGE>\nOpinion of Great Plains\' financial advisor (see page 28; Annex B)\n   Great Plains\' board of directors received an opinion from Great Plains\'\nfinancial advisor, Goldman, Sachs & Co., that, subject to the matters and\nassumptions set forth in that opinion, as of December 21, 2000, the exchange\nratio in connection with the merger was fair from a financial point of view to\nholders of Great Plains common stock.\nGreat Plains special meeting (see page 22)\n   The special meeting of Great Plains\' shareholders will be held on [      ],\n2001, at 9 a.m. Central time, at [          ]. At the meeting, you will be\nasked to approve a merger agreement that will cause Great Plains to become a\nwholly owned subsidiary of Microsoft. You can vote at the special meeting only\nif you owned shares of Great Plains common stock at the close of business on\n[      ], 2001, the record date.\nVotes required for approval (see page 22)\n   The holders of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of Great Plains\ncommon stock must approve the merger agreement. Great Plains\' shareholders are\nentitled to cast one vote for each share of Great Plains common stock they\nowned as of the record date. Each of Great Plains\' directors and executive\nofficers, who collectively held the power to vote approximately [22.9]% of\nGreat Plains\' outstanding common stock as of the record date, have already\nagreed to vote their shares in favor of the merger.\n   Microsoft\'s shareholders are not required to approve the merger and will not\nvote on the merger.\nConditions to completion of the merger (see page 43)\n   Great Plains\' and Microsoft\'s respective obligations to effect the merger\nare subject to the prior satisfaction or waiver of specific conditions. The\nconditions that must be satisfied or waived before the completion of the merger\ninclude the following, subject to exceptions and qualifications:\n  . Great Plains\' shareholders approve the merger agreement as required by\n    Minnesota law;\n  . no statute, regulation, order, decree or injunction prevents the merger;\n  . Great Plains and Microsoft receive all material consents and approvals\n    for the merger;\n  . Great Plains\' and Microsoft\'s respective representations and warranties\n    in the agreement are true and correct except in respects that do not have\n    a material adverse effect;\n  . no material adverse change has occurred with respect to Great Plains\'\n    business condition or the economic or business benefits expected from the\n    merger;\n  . both Great Plains and Microsoft materially perform their obligations\n    under the merger agreement;\n  . both Great Plains and Microsoft receive required legal opinions,\n    including opinions that the merger will be treated as a tax-free\n    reorganization for federal income tax purposes; and\n  . certain specified employees of Great Plains shall remain employed by\n    Great Plains immediately prior to closing.\n                                       7\n<PAGE>\nNo other negotiations involving Great Plains (see page 47)\n   Until the merger is completed or the merger agreement is terminated, Great\nPlains has agreed, with limited exceptions, not to directly or indirectly take\nany of the following actions with any party other than Microsoft:\n  . solicit, encourage, initiate or participate in any negotiations,\n    inquiries or discussions regarding any offer or proposal to acquire Great\n    Plains;\n  . enter into any agreement related to an acquisition of Great Plains;\n  . make any public statement, recommendation or solicitation in support of\n    an acquisition of Great Plains; or\n  . disclose any customarily nonpublic information about Great Plains in\n    connection with an acquisition of Great Plains.\n   However, Great Plains\' board of directors may recommend to shareholders that\nthey tender their shares in connection with a tender offer by an acquiror other\nthan Microsoft if the board determines in good faith that its fiduciary duty to\nits shareholders requires such a recommendation. In addition, upon notice to\nMicrosoft, the board may give information to a third party which has made an\nunsolicited acquisition proposal that the board reasonably believes is\nfinancially more favorable to Great Plains and its shareholders than the merger\nwith Microsoft.\n   Great Plains has agreed that it will inform Microsoft of the status and\ndetails of any unsolicited acquisition proposal or request for disclosure of or\naccess to nonpublic information that it receives.\nTermination of the merger agreement (see page 47)\n   Even if Great Plains\' shareholders approve the merger agreement, Microsoft\nand Great Plains can mutually agree at any time to terminate the merger\nagreement without completing the merger. In addition, subject to\nqualifications, the merger agreement may be terminated by either Great Plains\nor Microsoft under any of the following circumstances:\n  . if the merger is not completed by September 30, 2001 (subject to\n    extension to March 31, 2002, if Microsoft and Great Plains have agreed to\n    pursue litigation against any administrative or judicial action or\n    proceeding challenging the merger on the basis that it violates antitrust\n    law);\n  . if Great Plains\' shareholders do not approve the merger agreement;\n  . if the terminating party is not in material breach of any representation,\n    warranty, covenant or agreement contained in the merger agreement and the\n    other party breaches a representation, warranty, covenant or agreement in\n    the merger agreement and the breach has a material adverse effect on the\n    non-breaching party or on the benefits of the merger and has not been\n    cured or the breaching party is not using best efforts to cure the breach\n    within twenty days after notice is given to the breaching party;\n  . if either party determines it is not in its best interests to contest any\n    administrative or judicial action or proceeding challenging the merger on\n    the basis that it violates antitrust law; or\n  . if a final permanent injunction or other court order prohibiting the\n    merger is issued and is not appealable.\nIn addition, the merger agreement may also be terminated by Microsoft if:\n  . Great Plains\' board withdraws or modifies in an adverse manner its\n    approval or recommendation of the merger; or\n  . Great Plains or its representatives engage in the prohibited behavior,\n    described above, regarding potential acquisitions of Great Plains by\n    parties other than Microsoft.\n                                       8\n<PAGE>\nTermination fees (see page 48)\n   Microsoft has agreed to pay Great Plains a termination fee of $40 million if\nGreat Plains is not then in material breach of the merger agreement and Great\nPlains terminates the agreement as a result of a material breach by Microsoft\nof its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements and that breach has\nnot been cured or Microsoft is not using its best efforts to cure the breach\nwithin twenty days after notice is given to Microsoft.\n   Great Plains has agreed to pay Microsoft a termination fee of $40 million if\nMicrosoft is not then in material breach of the merger agreement and Microsoft\nterminates the merger agreement for any of the following reasons:\n  . Great Plains or its representatives engage in the prohibited behavior,\n    described above, regarding potential acquisitions of Great Plains by\n    parties other than Microsoft;\n  . Great Plains\' board of directors withdraws or adversely modifies its\n    approval or recommendation of the merger;\n  . Great Plains agrees to an acquisition by a party other than Microsoft in\n    a transaction that will result in a change in the beneficial ownership of\n    more than 50% of the voting power of Great Plains\' capital stock; or\n  . Great Plains materially breaches a representation, warranty, covenant or\n    agreement in the merger agreement and the breach has not been cured or\n    Great Plains is not using its best efforts to cure the breach within\n    twenty days after notice is given to Great Plains.\n   In addition, Microsoft has agreed to pay Great Plains a termination fee of\n$5 million if\n  . certain antitrust approvals have not been obtained before September 30,\n    2001 (subject to extension until March 31, 2002 if Great Plains and\n    Microsoft have agreed to pursue litigation against any administrative or\n    judicial action or proceeding challenging the merger on the basis that it\n    violates antitrust law); or\n  . either party terminates the agreement as a result of an administrative or\n    judicial action or proceeding challenging the merger on the basis that it\n    violates antitrust law and that party determines that it is not in its\n    best interest to contest the proceeding.\nGreat Plains management voting agreements (see page 50)\n   As a condition to the merger, Microsoft required all of Great Plains\'\ndirectors and executive officers, who collectively held the power to vote\napproximately [22.9]% of Great Plains\' outstanding common stock as of the\nrecord date, to enter into voting agreements with Microsoft. The voting\nagreements require Great Plains\' directors and executive officers to vote all\nof their shares in favor of the merger agreement. These shareholders have given\nirrevocable proxies to Microsoft to vote in favor of the merger. Great Plains\'\ndirectors and executive officers also agreed not to sell or otherwise dispose\nof any shares of Great Plains common stock they own or acquire until the\nexpiration of the voting agreement, unless the transferee of the shares agrees\nto the same restrictions.\nInterests of Great Plains\' directors, executive officers and certain employees\nin the merger (see page 37)\n   When considering the recommendation of Great Plains\' board of directors, you\nshould be aware that some of Great Plains\' directors and executive officers\nhave interests in the merger that are different from, or in addition to, yours.\nFor directors, these interests include accelerated vesting of stock options and\nindemnification rights. Additional interests of executive officers include\npotential severance benefits and other employment-\n                                       9\n<PAGE>\nrelated benefits. Great Plains\' board of directors was aware of and considered\nthese interests in approving the merger agreement and recommending that Great\nPlains\' shareholders approve the merger agreement.\nRestrictions on the ability to sell Microsoft stock (see page 39)\n   All shares of Microsoft common stock received by you in connection with the\nmerger will be freely transferable unless you are considered an affiliate of\neither Great Plains or Microsoft under the Securities Act of 1933. Shares of\nMicrosoft common stock held by affiliates may be sold only pursuant to an\neffective registration statement or an exemption from registration under the\nSecurities Act. Microsoft has received letter agreements from each of Great\nPlains\' executive officers and directors, each of whom may be considered an\naffiliate of Great Plains, agreeing to abide by these restrictions.\n   In addition, Doug Burgum, the chairman and chief executive officer of Great\nPlains, has entered into an agreement under which he has agreed that certain\npercentages of the Microsoft common stock to be issued in the merger to him\nshall be restricted from transfer until the fourth anniversary of the merger.\nThe time periods during which these restrictions apply will be extended by an\nadditional year under the agreement if Mr. Burgum ceases to be employed by\nGreat Plains or Microsoft prior to the second anniversary of the merger.\nTax consequences of the merger (see page 39)\n   Microsoft and Great Plains intend the merger to qualify as a tax-free\nreorganization under the Internal Revenue Code. It is a condition to the\ncompletion of the merger that both parties receive an opinion from their\nrespective tax counsel that the merger will so qualify. We expect that none of\nGreat Plains, Microsoft or their respective shareholders will recognize a gain\nor loss for United States federal income tax purposes, except with respect to\ncash received in lieu of fractional shares of Microsoft common stock or with\nrespect to cash received upon exercise of dissenters\' rights. Because tax\nmatters are complicated, however, we urge you to consult your own tax advisor\nto understand fully how the merger will affect you, including how any state,\nlocal or foreign tax laws may apply to you.\nAccounting treatment of the merger (see page 41)\n   Microsoft expects to account for the merger using the purchase method of\naccounting under generally accepted accounting principles.\nRegulatory approvals required to complete the merger (see page 41)\n   The merger is subject to antitrust laws, including the reporting and waiting\nperiod provisions of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act. On January 19, 2001, each of\nMicrosoft and Great Plains made the required premerger notification filings\nwith the Federal Trade Commission and the Antitrust Division of the Department\nof Justice.\n   Due to the international scope of Microsoft\'s and Great Plains\' businesses,\nregulatory filings will also be required in certain European and other\njurisdictions. Microsoft and Great Plains do not expect those non-U.S. filings\nto affect the expected timing of the merger.\nDissenters\' rights (see page 59; Annex C)\n   Under Minnesota law, Great Plains\' shareholders have the right to dissent\nfrom the merger and to receive payment in cash for the fair value of their\nshares of Great Plains common stock. To preserve their rights, Great Plains\'\nshareholders who wish to exercise their statutory dissenters\' rights must\nprecisely follow the procedures described in Sections 302A.471 and 302A.473 of\nthe Minnesota Business Corporation Act, attached to this proxy\nstatement/prospectus as Annex C.\n                                       10\n<PAGE>\nDifferences in rights of Great Plains and Microsoft shareholders (see page 51)\n   The rights of Great Plains\' shareholders are governed by Minnesota law and\nGreat Plains\' articles of incorporation and bylaws. When the merger is\ncompleted, Great Plains\' shareholders will become shareholders of Microsoft.\nBecause Microsoft is a Washington corporation, following the merger the rights\nof former Great Plains\' shareholders will be governed by Washington law. In\naddition, following the merger the rights of Great Plains\' shareholders will be\ngoverned by Microsoft\'s articles of incorporation and bylaws, which differ from\nGreat Plains\' articles of incorporation and bylaws.\nComparative market price information (see page 20)\n   Shares of both Microsoft common stock and Great Plains common stock are\nlisted on the Nasdaq Stock Market. On December 20, 2000, the last full trading\nday before the public announcement of the proposed merger, Microsoft\'s common\nstock closed at $41.50 per share and Great Plains\' common stock closed at\n$35.3125 per share. On [      ], 2001, the last full trading day for which\nclosing prices were available at the time of the printing of this proxy\nstatement/prospectus, Microsoft\'s common stock closed at $[   ] per share and\nGreat Plains\' common stock closed at $[   ] per share. We urge you to obtain\ncurrent market quotations.\n                                       11\n<PAGE>\n             SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA OF MICROSOFT AND GREAT PLAINS\n   The following tables provide selected financial data of Microsoft and Great\nPlains, which were derived from the audited financial statements of Microsoft\nand Great Plains for the last five years for which audited financial statements\nhave been prepared. The data should be read in conjunction with the financial\nstatements, related notes and other financial information of Microsoft and\nGreat Plains that are incorporated by reference into this proxy\nstatement/prospectus. The Microsoft table provides selected financial data of\nMicrosoft as of September 30, 2000 and for the three months ended September 30,\n2000 and 1999, which were derived from the unaudited financial statements of\nMicrosoft. In the opinion of Microsoft management, the unaudited statements\ninclude all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring items, necessary\nfor their fair presentation in conformity with U.S. generally accepted\naccounting principles. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of\nresults for a full year. The Great Plains table also provides selected\nfinancial data of Great Plains as of November 30, 2000 and for the six months\nended November 30, 2000 and 1999, which were derived from unaudited financial\nstatements of Great Plains.

A\n    majority of the amortization of acquired intangible assets related to\n    acquisitions completed in the latter half of fiscal 2000 and the first half\n    of fiscal 2001 are not deductible for income tax purposes.\n(4) For the fiscal years ending May 31, 1996 and 1997, basic net income (loss)\n    per share is lower than the diluted net income (loss) per share due to the\n    fact that net income available to common shareholders for the basic\n    calculation is reduced by the increase in carrying value of the mandatorily\n    redeemable preferred stock. This increase in carrying value has a greater\n    impact on the basic calculation than does the inclusion of the preferred\n    shares in the diluted calculation. The mandatorily redeemable preferred\n    stock was converted into shares of common stock in June 1997 in connection\n    with Great Plains\' initial public offering.\n                                       13\n<PAGE>\n         COMPARATIVE HISTORICAL AND UNAUDITED PRO FORMA PER SHARE DATA\n   The following table presents:\n  . historical and unaudited pro forma combined net income per share and net\n    tangible book value per share data of Microsoft; and\n  . historical and unaudited equivalent pro forma net income (loss) per share\n    and net tangible book value per share data of Great Plains.\n   The pro forma combined per share data was derived from financial information\nof Microsoft and Great Plains incorporated by reference into this proxy\nstatement/prospectus.

The market value of Microsoft common stock is likely to change, both\nbefore and after the merger, and no one can accurately predict what the market\nvalue will be at any given time. Market prices of Microsoft and Great Plains\ncommon stock may vary for many reasons, including changes in the business,\noperations or prospects of Microsoft or Great Plains, market assessments of the\nlikelihood that the merger will be completed, the timing of regulatory\nconsiderations and general market and economic conditions. Because the merger\nwill be completed after the special meeting, the prices of Microsoft and Great\nPlains common stock on the date of the special meeting may not be indicative of\ntheir prices on the date the merger is completed. Great Plains cannot terminate\nthe merger or resolicit the vote of its shareholders based solely on changes in\nthe value of Microsoft common stock. We urge you to obtain current market\nquotations for Microsoft and Great Plains common stock.\nGreat Plains\' directors and executive officers have interests that are\ndifferent from, or in addition to, those of other shareholders, which may\ninfluence them to support the merger.\n   The directors and executive officers of Great Plains participate in\narrangements that provide them with interests in the merger that are different\nfrom, or are in addition to, yours. For directors, these interests include\naccelerated vesting of stock options and indemnification rights. Additional\ninterests of executive officers include potential severance benefits and other\nemployment-related benefits. As a result, Great Plains\' directors and executive\nofficers could be more likely to support approval of the merger than if they\ndid not hold these interests. You should consider whether these interests may\nhave influenced these directors and executive officers to support and recommend\nthe merger.\nAnnouncement of the merger could negatively impact Great Plains\' stock price\nand future business and operations.\n   Great Plains customers may, in response to the announcement of the merger,\ndelay or defer purchasing decisions. Any delay or deferral in purchasing\ndecisions by Great Plains customers could have a material adverse effect on\nGreat Plains\' business, regardless of whether or not the merger is ultimately\ncompleted. Some current and prospective Great Plains employees may experience\nuncertainty about their future role within the combined companies. This may\nadversely affect Great Plains\' ability to attract and retain key management,\nmarketing, technical, sales and other personnel.\nFailure to complete the merger could negatively impact Great Plains\' stock\nprice and future business and operations.\n   If the merger is not completed for any reason, Great Plains may be subject\nto a number of material risks, including the following:\n  . Great Plains may be required to pay Microsoft a termination fee of $40\n    million;\n                                       15\n<PAGE>\n  . the price of Great Plains common stock may decline to the extent that the\n    current market price of Great Plains common stock reflects an assumption\n    that the merger will be completed; and\n  . Great Plains must pay its costs related to the merger, including legal\n    and accounting fees and financial advisory expenses.\n   Further, if the merger is terminated and Great Plains\' board of directors\ndetermines to seek another merger or business combination, it may not be able\nto find a partner willing to pay an equivalent or more attractive price than\nthat which would have been paid in the merger. In addition, while the merger\nagreement is in effect, subject to limited exceptions described on page 47 of\nthis proxy statement/prospectus, Great Plains is prohibited from soliciting,\ninitiating, participating in any negotiations regarding, or entering into\nspecified extraordinary transactions, such as a merger, sale of assets or other\nbusiness combination with any party other than Microsoft.\nThe price of Microsoft common stock may be affected by factors different from\nthose affecting the price of Great Plains common stock.\n   Upon completion of the merger, the holders of Great Plains common stock will\nbecome holders of Microsoft common stock. Microsoft\'s business differs from\nthat of Great Plains, and Microsoft\'s results of operations and the price of\nMicrosoft common stock may be affected by factors different from those that\naffected Great Plains\' results of operations and the price of Great Plains\ncommon stock before the merger. For a discussion of Microsoft\'s and Great\nPlains\' businesses and factors to consider in connection with those businesses,\nsee Microsoft\'s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30,\n2000, other documents Microsoft has subsequently filed with the SEC, Great\nPlains\' Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2000 and\nother documents Great Plains has subsequently filed with the SEC, which are\nincorporated by reference into this proxy statement/prospectus.\nRisks related to Microsoft\'s business\nMicrosoft\'s current position in the market for computer software is\ncontinuously threatened because this market is intensely competitive and\ntechnology is constantly changing.\n   Microsoft is the leading producer of software for personal computers (""PCs"")\nin the world. Nonetheless, rapid change, uncertainty due to new and emerging\ntechnologies and fierce competition characterize the PC software industry,\nwhich means that Microsoft\'s market position is always at risk. Microsoft\'s\nability to maintain its current market share may depend upon its ability to\nsatisfy customer requirements, enhance existing products, develop and introduce\nnew products and achieve market acceptance of such products. This process is\nchallenging since the pace of change continues to accelerate, including with\nrespect to ""open source"" software, new computing devices, new microprocessor\narchitectures, the Internet and Web-based computing models. If Microsoft does\nnot successfully identify new product opportunities and develop and bring new\nproducts to market in a timely and cost-efficient manner, its business growth\nwill suffer and demand for its products will decrease.\n   Further, the PC software industry is inherently complex. New products and\nproduct enhancements can require long development and testing periods.\nSignificant delays in new product releases or significant problems in creating\nnew products could damage Microsoft\'s business.\n   The competition in the PC software industry is intense and may have multiple\neffects. For example, competing companies and systems may gain market share,\nwhich could have the effect of directly or indirectly reducing Microsoft\'s\nexisting market share. In addition, competitors, working with new technology,\nmay arrive at a technology that creates a new market altogether and renders\nMicrosoft\'s product offerings obsolete. Microsoft expects that the overall\nnumber of competitors providing niche products that compete with its products\nwill increase due to the market\'s attractive growth.\n                                       16\n<PAGE>\n   While Microsoft works closely with computer manufacturers and developers,\nother companies promote their platforms and technologies against Microsoft\'s\nproducts and existing industry standards. These operating systems, platforms\nand products may gain popularity with customers, computer manufacturers and\ndevelopers, reducing Microsoft\'s future revenues. For example, Microsoft is\nengaged in intense competition with companies that develop and support\noperating systems such as the open source Linux operating system and Unix\noperating systems for many business installations. These competitors include\nCaldera Systems, Inc., Red Hat, Inc., IBM and Sun Microsystems, Inc. This\nincreased level of competition may result in price reductions, lower-than-\nexpected gross margins or Microsoft\'s inability to maintain its market share,\nany of which may result in a loss of revenue and cause Microsoft\'s business to\nsuffer.\nBecause of increasing competition in the PC industry, Microsoft may experience\nreduced product sales and lower revenue growth.\n   The nature of the PC market is changing in ways that may reduce Microsoft\'s\nsoftware sales and its revenue growth. Microsoft earns a portion of its revenue\nby licensing its software to PC manufacturers, who install Microsoft\napplications during production and sell PCs to consumers that are fully\noperational at the time of purchase. Recently, manufacturers have sought to\nreach more consumers by developing and producing lower cost PCs that come\nwithout pre-installed software or contain software with reduced functionality\nto keep prices down.\n   In addition to the influx of low-cost PCs, a market has developed for hand-\nheld computing and communication devices, such as hand-held computers and\nwireless communication devices that have the ability to communicate with the\nInternet.\n   While these devices are not as powerful or versatile as PCs, they threaten\nto erode sales growth in the market for PCs with pre-installed software. This\nmay affect Microsoft\'s revenue growth because manufacturers may choose not to\ninstall Microsoft software in these low-cost PCs or consumers may purchase\nalternative devices that do not utilize Microsoft software. These lower-priced\ndevices require Microsoft to provide lower-priced software with a subset of the\noriginal functionality. As a result, Microsoft will experience slower revenue\ngrowth from the sale of software produced for these devices than from the sale\nof software for traditional PCs.\n   In addition, in response to present and future anticipated competitive\npressures in its industry, Microsoft is providing alternative distribution of\nits products at a cost lower than if the customer were to purchase the\nindividual products in a shrink-wrapped box at a traditional retail, mail order\nor online store. For example, Microsoft offers suites of software products like\nthe Microsoft Office suite, which is a collection of stand-alone products such\nas Excel, Word, Outlook and PowerPoint. By packaging the products as a suite,\nMicrosoft offers customers the opportunity to purchase a license to use a\ncollection of products for less cost than purchasing each of the individually-\nlicensed products in standard boxes from a retail, mail order or online store.\nAdditionally, Microsoft is offering products through alternative distribution\nchannels other than the standard individually shrink-wrapped boxes sold through\ntraditional retail vendors. These channels include:\n  . Licensing agreements--customers may purchase multiple-user licenses for a\n    suite of products for a lower cost than paying for each license\n    separately;\n  . Subscriptions--customers may enter into an annual gold license, which\n    entitles them to automatic upgrades and replacement products for a lower\n    cost than acquiring upgrades and replacement products on an individual\n    basis; and\n  . Downloads over the Internet--customers are able to download service\n    releases and upgrades as well as other products directly from the\n    Internet.\n   As a result of responding to competitive pressures in the marketplace by\noffering products through alternative distribution methods, Microsoft may\nexperience slower revenue growth.\n                                       17\n<PAGE>\nPrices of Microsoft products could decrease, which would reduce its net income.\n   The competitive factors described above may require Microsoft to lower\nproduct prices to meet competition. Since Microsoft\'s cost of revenue is\nalready very low, price reductions would reduce its net income.\nDeveloping software is expensive, and the investment in product development\noften involves a long payback cycle.\n   Microsoft\'s continued success depends in part on its continued ability to\ncreate more versatile software products faster than its competitors. Microsoft\nplans to continue significant investments in software research and development.\nIt also expends significant resources on researching and developing new\ntechnologies such as voice recognition and ClearType software, a software that\nprovides improved font sharpness and text display on color LCD screens allowing\nfor better on-screen reading comparable to reading on paper. Microsoft is also\nmaking significant investments in strategic relationships with third parties\nwhere Microsoft has the opportunity to establish leadership in new businesses.\nMicrosoft anticipates that these investments in research and development will\nincrease over historical spending levels without corresponding growth in\nrevenues in the near future. Microsoft cannot assure that significant revenue\nfrom these product opportunities will be achieved for a number of years, if at\nall.\nMicrosoft\'s profit margins internationally may be threatened by factors in\nother countries that are outside of its control and force down the price of its\nsoftware relative to its costs.\n   Microsoft develops and sells its products throughout the world. The prices\nof Microsoft products in countries outside of the United States are generally\nhigher than Microsoft\'s prices in the United States because of the costs\nincurred in localizing software for non-U.S. markets and the higher costs of\nproducing and selling its products in these countries. Pressures to globalize\nMicrosoft\'s pricing structure might require that it reduce the sales price of\nits software in other countries, even though the costs of the software continue\nto be higher than in the United States. This would reduce Microsoft\'s margins\nand result in overall declines in its revenue growth.\n   Negative changes in the following factors, among others, could also have an\nimpact on Microsoft\'s business and results of operations outside of the United\nStates:\n  . software ""piracy"" trade protection laws, policies and measures and other\n    regulatory requirements affecting trade and investment;\n  . unexpected changes in regulatory requirements for software;\n  . social, political, labor or economic conditions in a specific country or\n    region;\n  . difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations; and\n  . potential adverse foreign tax consequences.\nMicrosoft\'s intellectual property rights may be difficult to protect.\n   Microsoft diligently defends its intellectual property rights, but\nunlicensed copying of software represents a loss of revenue. While this\nadversely affects U.S. revenue, revenue loss is even more significant outside\nof the U.S., particularly in countries where laws are less protective of\nintellectual property rights. Throughout the world, Microsoft actively educates\nconsumers on the benefits of licensing genuine products and educates lawmakers\non the advantages of a business climate where intellectual property rights are\nprotected. However, continued efforts may not affect revenue positively.\n                                       18\n<PAGE>\nMicrosoft cannot predict the outcome or impact of antitrust claims by the U.S.\nand several states.\n   Microsoft is a defendant in a lawsuit filed by the Antitrust Division of the\nU.S. Department of Justice and a group of nineteen state attorneys general\nalleging violations of the Sherman Act and various state antitrust laws. After\ntrial, the District Court entered Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law\nstating that Microsoft had violated the Sherman Act and various state antitrust\nlaws. A judgment was entered on June 7, 2000 that if not stayed or modified,\nwould require the breakup of Microsoft into two companies and would impose\nsevere product design and business conduct restrictions. On June 13, 2000,\nMicrosoft filed an appeal of the judgment. On June 20, 2000, the District Court\nentered an order staying the judgment of June 7, 2000 in its entirety until the\nappeal therefrom is heard and decided, unless the stay is earlier vacated by an\nappellate court. The Court of Appeals will hear oral argument on Microsoft\'s\nappeal on February 26-27, 2001. Although Microsoft believes it will obtain\nultimate relief from the judgment, Microsoft cannot predict with certainty when\nor the extent to which such relief will be obtained. The failure to obtain\nsufficient relief through the appeal could have a material adverse effect on\nthe value of Microsoft\'s common stock and/or the stock of the two resulting\ncompanies if the divestiture is finally approved. For more information\nconcerning this litigation, particularly the current status of the litigation\nwhich is changing very rapidly, you are encouraged to review Microsoft\'s other\nSEC filings, which are incorporated below under ""Where You Can Find More\nInformation"" and copies of orders, motions, briefs and other court filings that\nare available at the following websites:\n  . www.microsoft.com/presspass/trial/default.asp,\n  . www.usdoj.gov/atr/cases/ms index.htm and\n  . www.dcd.uscourts.gov/microsoft-all.html.\nMicrosoft may not be able to maintain its present revenue growth rate or\noperating margins.\n   Microsoft\'s revenue growth rate in 2001 may not approach the level attained\nin prior years. Operating expenses are expected to increase from historical\nlevels. Because of the fixed nature of a significant portion of such expenses,\ncoupled with the possibility of slower revenue growth, operating margins may\ndecrease from historical levels.\n                                       19\n<PAGE>\n                COMPARATIVE STOCK PRICE AND DIVIDEND INFORMATION\n   Great Plains common stock has been traded on the Nasdaq Stock Market under\nthe symbol GPSI since June 20, 1997, the date of Great Plains\' initial public\noffering.

While we believe that this description covers the material terms of the\nmerger, this summary may not contain all of the information that is important\nto you. You should carefully read this entire proxy statement/prospectus and\nthe other documents to which we refer for a more complete understanding of the\nmerger.\nBackground of the merger\n   Great Plains and Microsoft have enjoyed a close working relationship since\nthe late 1980\'s. Great Plains has historically been a developer of products\nbased on Microsoft platforms. Over the years, Great Plains has worked\nextensively with Microsoft to more fully utilize the capabilities of Microsoft\ntools, languages, databases and operating systems. More recently, Great Plains\nwas an initial technical collaborator with Microsoft in the newly announced\n .NET technology. Great Plains\' current products are very compatible with\nMicrosoft productivity tools and database offerings, with similar user\ninterfaces, similar help systems and built-in Microsoft development tools.\nGreat Plains and Microsoft have also developed joint product solutions and\nconducted marketing initiatives from time to time and have purchased and sold\nproducts to each other.\n   In September of 1999, after a significant amount of joint work and\ndiscussion around the Microsoft .NET platform adoption by Great Plains, Great\nPlains and Microsoft executives and key technical leaders met to discuss the\ntwo companies\' technical and marketing relationship and to explore the\npossibility of the two companies partnering further around key e-commerce and\n .Net initiatives. However, there were no business combination discussions at\nthese meetings.\n   In March of 2000, Great Plains and Microsoft signed a joint cooperation\nagreement to work together in the area of the .NET runtime. At this time Great\nPlains was one of the only companies committed to working on this technology.\nAccordingly, there was support among Microsoft management that Microsoft should\nlook into ways of partnering more closely with Great Plains.\n   During this time Steve Ballmer, the Chief Executive Officer of Microsoft,\nand David Vaskevitch, the Senior Vice President of Microsoft\'s Business\nApplication Division, began to discuss the formation of a new company division\nfocused on business applications. Mr. Vaskevitch assumed the role of leading\nMicrosoft\'s new business applications division at the end of March 2000 to\nfocus on Microsoft\'s efforts in key e-commerce and business applications. Great\nPlains was considered a key Microsoft ally in this business sector.\n   In June 2000, Mr. Vaskevitch proposed to Mr. Ballmer that Microsoft consider\nthe acquisition of Great Plains to support Microsoft efforts in the business\napplications domain. On June 20, 2000, Mr. Ballmer placed a telephone call to\nDoug Burgum, CEO of Great Plains, in which they discussed the upcoming visit to\nGreat Plains by Mr. Vaskevitch, and the possibility of acquisition of Great\nPlains by Microsoft. On June 26, 2000, with Mr. Ballmer\'s approval,\nMr. Vaskevitch and key members of his team visited Great Plains at their\ncorporate headquarters and reviewed the decision to create a business\napplications division within Microsoft, and discussed the current offerings\nfrom Microsoft\'s bCentral Internet site. Later that day, in a meeting between\nMr. Vaskevitch and Mr. Burgum, the possibility of a business combination with\nGreat Plains was again discussed.\n   During the months of July, August and September of 2000, Microsoft and Great\nPlains team members held a number of joint meetings intended to compare goals\nand objectives of both organizations, as well as to test the cultural and\nbusiness method compatibility between the companies. A variety of scenarios\nwere considered, including Great Plains remaining independent from Microsoft\nbut expanding the current partnering activities.\n   On October 16, 2000, Mr. Vaskevitch and his team made a presentation on the\npossible business combination to the Strategic Leadership Team, a group\ncomposed of senior Microsoft executives. That group\n                                       25\n<PAGE>\napproved moving ahead with acquisition negotiations contingent on the support\nof Jeff Raikes, a Group Vice President at Microsoft.\n   Mr. Ballmer and Mr. Burgum met the next day to further discuss the\nopportunities presented by a potential business combination. To further this\nprocess, Mr. Raikes met with Mr. Burgum and other Great Plains executives on\nnumerous occasions beginning October 21, 2000. Mr. Raikes and Mr. Vaskevitch\npresented their thoughts and findings relating to the acquisition to the\nMicrosoft board of directors on November 9, 2000. The Microsoft board approved\nthe acquisition of Great Plains pending due diligence.\n   During this same time, through a number of strategy planning meetings, the\nGreat Plains management team considered if a business combination could\naccelerate the delivery of the next generation of business applications to its\ntarget market of small and medium-size (mid-market) businesses. Concurrent with\nthese planning meetings, Great Plains\' management team informed and consulted\nwith Great Plains\' board of directors through a series of board meetings which\nincluded presentations from both Great Plains\' management team and outside\nadvisors including Goldman Sachs, Great Plains\' financial advisor.\n   On October 20, 2000, Goldman Sachs was formally engaged to act as Great\nPlains financial advisor in connection with a possible sale of Great Plains.\nGoldman Sachs has been Great Plains\' lead investment banker since Great Plains\'\nJune 1997 initial public offering. On October 24, 2000, the Great Plains board\nof directors held a meeting to discuss business strategies. Representatives of\nGoldman Sachs, who were also present at this meeting, discussed with the Great\nPlains board of directors, among other matters, possible strategic and other\nbusiness combination opportunities, including a potential strategic transaction\nwith Microsoft.\n   During the first half of November 2000, representatives of Great Plains and\nMicrosoft, in consultation with their respective legal and financial advisors,\nengaged in preliminary discussions concerning the possible terms for an\nacquisition of Great Plains by Microsoft. On November 17, 2000, Great Plains\nand Microsoft management approved a non-binding list of acquisition terms and\nagreed to begin their respective due diligence investigations and preparation\nof definitive agreements.\n   Commencing on November 27, 2000, management from Microsoft and Great Plains,\nas well as legal counsel and other representatives and advisors of both\ncompanies, worked to facilitate the completion of the due diligence\ninvestigations in anticipation of the acquisition. During this time, Microsoft\nand its counsel prepared draft definitive agreements, and the parties and their\nlegal counsel negotiated final documents.\n   From December 6 through December 12, 2000, the parties, together with their\ncounsel, met in Seattle to discuss and negotiate the definitive agreements. On\nDecember 20, the final merger agreement was presented to the Great Plains board\nof directors who, after a presentation from Goldman Sachs, approved the\ntransaction, conditional upon the receipt of a fairness opinion from Goldman\nSachs. Goldman Sachs delivered its fairness opinion early in the morning of\nDecember 21, 2000, and the merger agreement was executed and the transaction\nannounced that same day.\nGreat Plains\' reasons for the merger\n   In reaching its decision to approve and adopt the merger agreement and to\nunanimously recommend that Great Plains shareholders approve the merger\nagreement, Great Plains\' board identified reasons why the merger should be\nbeneficial to Great Plains and its shareholders, employees, partners and\ncustomers. These potential benefits include the following:\n  . the opportunity for Great Plains shareholders to receive a premium for\n    their shares based upon the market prices of Great Plains and Microsoft\n    common stock immediately prior to the public\n                                       26\n<PAGE>\n   announcement of the merger. Specifically, the exchange ratio in the merger\n   represented a 29.3% premium over the closing price for Great Plains common\n   stock on December 20, 2000, the last trading day before Great Plains and\n   Microsoft announced the merger;\n  . the ability of Great Plains shareholders to continue to participate in\n    the growth of the business conducted by Microsoft and Great Plains\n    following the merger and to benefit from the potential appreciation in\n    value of shares of Microsoft common stock;\n  . the larger public float and trading volumes of shares of Microsoft common\n    stock compared to the public float and trading volumes of shares of Great\n    Plains common stock, which would provide Great Plains shareholders with\n    the opportunity to gain greater liquidity in their investment;\n  . the enhanced ability of Great Plains to execute against its mission\n    statement (to improve the lives and business success of its partners and\n    customers) and on its business plan based on the combined resources of\n    Great Plains and Microsoft; and\n  . the potential for increased opportunities for Great Plains employees and\n    partners, and the potential for even better solutions for Great Plains\n    current and future customers.\n   In the course of deliberations, Great Plains\' board also reviewed with its\nexecutive management team and its legal and financial advisors a number of\nadditional factors relevant to the merger, including:\n  . the terms and conditions of the merger agreement, including termination\n    fees and closing conditions;\n  . the likelihood that the merger would be completed;\n  . the expected qualification of the merger as a tax-free reorganization\n    under Section 368 of the Internal Revenue Code;\n  . the opinion of Goldman Sachs to the effect that, as of the date of the\n    merger agreement and subject to the considerations set forth in the\n    opinion, the 1.1 exchange ratio was fair to shareholders of Great Plains\n    from a financial point of view. (The full text of the opinion, which\n    describes assumptions made, matters considered and limitations on the\n    review undertaken in connection with the opinion, is attached as Annex B\n    and Great Plains shareholders are encouraged to read the opinion in its\n    entirety.);\n  . information relating to the business, assets, management, competitive\n    position, operating performance, trading performance and prospects of\n    each of Great Plains and Microsoft, including the prospects of Great\n    Plains if it were to continue as an independent company;\n  . current economic and financial market conditions and historical market\n    prices, volatility and trading information for Great Plains common stock\n    and Microsoft common stock;\n  . the belief, based on presentations by Great Plains\' legal and financial\n    advisors, that the terms of the merger agreement, including the limited\n    conditions to Microsoft\'s obligation to close the merger and the ability\n    of Great Plains to consider proposed alternative business combinations\n    under certain circumstances, are generally customary for transactions\n    such as the merger;\n  . whether strategic alternatives to the merger would enhance long-term\n    shareholder value; and\n  . discussions with management as to their due diligence investigations of\n    Microsoft.\n   Great Plains\' board also considered and balanced against the potential\nbenefits of the merger a number of potentially negative factors, including,\nwithout limitation, the following:\n  . the risk that the merger would not be consummated and the effect of the\n    public announcement of the merger on Great Plains\' sales and operating\n    results and Great Plains\' ability to attract and retain key management,\n    marketing, technical, sales and other personnel;\n  . the possibility that the market value of Microsoft common stock might\n    decrease prior to closing, causing less aggregate value to be paid to\n    Great Plains shareholders;\n                                       27\n<PAGE>\n  . a recognition that Microsoft common stock is traded at high valuation\n    multiples, and the risk that those multiples might not be sustained in\n    the future;\n  . the fact that shareholders of Great Plains will not receive the full\n    benefit of any future growth in the value of their equity that Great\n    Plains may have achieved as an independent company, and the potential\n    disadvantage to Great Plains shareholders who receive Microsoft common\n    stock in the event that Microsoft does not perform as well in the future\n    as Great Plains may have performed as an independent company;\n  . the possibility that some provisions of the merger agreement, including\n    the no-solicitation and termination fee payment provisions, might have\n    the effect of discouraging other persons potentially interested in\n    merging with or acquiring Great Plains from pursuing such an opportunity;\n    and\n  . other matters described in the section entitled ""Risk factors"" beginning\n    on page 15.\n   Great Plains\' board concluded that overall these risks were outweighed by\nthe potential benefits of the merger, and determined that the merger was fair\nto and in the best interests of Great Plains and its shareholders.\n   The above discussion does not include all of the information and factors\nconsidered by Great Plains\' board. In view of the variety of factors considered\nin connection with its evaluation of the merger agreement, Great Plains\' board\ndid not find it practicable to and did not quantify or otherwise assign\nrelative weight to the specific factors considered in reaching its\ndetermination. In addition, individual members of Great Plains\' board may have\ngiven different weight to different factors.\nRecommendation of Great Plains\' board of directors\n   After carefully evaluating these factors, both positive and negative, Great\nPlains\' board of directors has determined that the merger is fair to, and in\nthe best interests of, Great Plains and its shareholders. Great Plains\' board\nof directors unanimously recommends that you vote ""FOR"" approval of the merger\nagreement.\nOpinion of Great Plains\' financial advisor\n   Goldman, Sachs & Co. delivered an oral opinion, subsequently confirmed by\ndelivery of a written opinion to the board of directors of Great Plains, dated\nas of December 21, 2000, that, subject to the matters and assumptions set forth\nin the opinion, as of that date, the exchange ratio in connection with the\nmerger was fair from a financial point of view to the holders of shares of\nGreat Plains common stock.\n   The full text of the written opinion of Goldman Sachs, dated as of December\n21, 2000, which sets forth the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters\nconsidered and limitations on the review undertaken by Goldman Sachs in\nconnection with the opinion, is attached as Annex B and is incorporated by\nreference in this proxy statement/prospectus. Great Plains shareholders are\nurged to, and should read, the opinion in its entirety.\n   In connection with its opinion, Goldman Sachs reviewed, among other things:\n  . the merger agreement;\n  . the Registration Statement on Form S-1 of Great Plains, dated March 5,\n    1997;\n  . annual reports to stockholders and annual reports on Form 10-K of Great\n    Plains for the three fiscal years ended May 31, 2000;\n  . annual reports to stockholders and annual reports on Form 10-K of\n    Microsoft for the five fiscal years ended June 30, 2000;\n  . various interim reports to stockholders and quarterly reports on Form 10-\n    Q of Great Plains and Microsoft;\n                                       28\n<PAGE>\n  . various other communications from Great Plains and Microsoft to their\n    respective stockholders; and\n  . various internal financial analyses and forecasts for Great Plains\n    prepared by the management of Great Plains.\n   Goldman Sachs also held discussions with members of the senior management of\nGreat Plains regarding their assessment of the strategic rationale for, and the\npotential benefits of, the merger and the past and current business operations,\nfinancial condition and future prospects of Great Plains and Microsoft. In\naddition, Goldman Sachs:\n  . reviewed the reported price and trading activity for the common stock of\n    Great Plains and Microsoft;\n  . compared financial and stock market information for Great Plains and\n    Microsoft with similar information for the securities of other publicly\n    traded companies;\n  . reviewed the financial terms of recent business combinations in the\n    software industry specifically, and in other industries generally; and\n  . performed other studies and analyses that Goldman Sachs considered\n    appropriate.\n   Goldman Sachs relied upon the accuracy and completeness of all of the\nfinancial and other information that was discussed with or reviewed by it.\nGoldman Sachs assumed the accuracy and completeness of this information for\npurposes of rendering its opinion. Goldman Sachs did not make an independent\nevaluation or appraisal of the assets and liabilities of Great Plains or\nMicrosoft or any of their subsidiaries and was not furnished with an evaluation\nor appraisal of any of these assets or liabilities. With the consent of the\nGreat Plains board of directors, Goldman Sachs took into account Great Plains\'\nmanagement\'s views of the risks and uncertainties relating to Great Plains\'\nability to achieve the forecasts prepared by its management in the amounts and\ntime periods contemplated by those forecasts. Microsoft did not make available\nto Goldman Sachs its projections of its expected future performance and,\ntherefore, Goldman Sachs\' review of these matters was limited to discussions\nwith Microsoft\'s management of specific research analysts\' estimates.\n   With the consent of the Great Plains board of directors, Goldman Sachs did\nnot conduct an independent evaluation of the pending litigation against\nMicrosoft, including litigation regarding antitrust and intellectual property\nmatters, or the resulting liability or other consequences Microsoft may incur\nin connection with that litigation. Based on the information contained in\nMicrosoft\'s public filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and on\nMicrosoft\'s representations and warranties contained in the merger agreement\nand after consulting with counsel to Great Plains, the Great Plains board of\ndirectors directed Goldman Sachs in rendering its opinion to assume that the\npending litigation will not have a material adverse effect on Microsoft\'s\nfinancial condition or results of operations, the market price of Microsoft\ncommon stock or the conduct of the operations of Microsoft and its\nsubsidiaries. Goldman Sachs was not requested to solicit, and did not solicit,\ninterest from other parties with respect to an acquisition of or other business\ncombination with Great Plains (other than a limited discussion with one party\nwhich expressed an interest in Great Plains). Goldman Sachs provided its\nadvisory services and opinion for the information and assistance of the board\nof directors of Great Plains in connection with its consideration of the\nmerger. Goldman Sachs\' opinion does not constitute a recommendation as to how\nany holder of common stock of Great Plains should vote with respect to the\nmerger.\n   The following is a summary of the material financial analyses presented by\nGoldman Sachs to Great Plains in connection with the rendering of the Goldman\nSachs opinion. This summary does not purport to be a complete description of\nthe analyses performed by Goldman Sachs. The order of the analyses described,\nand the results of those analyses, do not represent the relative importance or\nweight given to the analyses by Goldman Sachs.\n                                       29\n<PAGE>\n   The following summaries of financial analyses include information presented\nin tabular format.

Goldman Sachs performed a discounted cash\nflow analysis by calculating the present value of the future cash flows that\nwould be produced by Great Plains for 2000 through 2005 based upon Great\nPlains\' management forecasts. Goldman Sachs calculated the terminal values\nbased on multiples of estimated 2005 earnings per share, or EPS, ranging from\n20x to 28x.

Goldman Sachs analyzed the financial impact of\nthe merger to the EPS of Microsoft common stock assuming the completion of the\nmerger. Based on management estimates for Great Plains\' 2001 EPS and, following\na Microsoft public conference call on December 14, 2000 and discussions with\nMicrosoft\'s management, on Goldman Sachs public analyst estimates for\nMicrosoft\'s 2001 EPS, this analysis indicated that the merger would have a\ndilutive effect on Microsoft\'s 2001 EPS.\n  (8) Exchange Ratio Analysis. Goldman Sachs reviewed the exchange ratio\nhistory for various periods ending December 20, 2000, including the period\nbeginning July 1, 1997, the date of Great Plains\' initial public offering or\nIPO. Goldman Sachs calculated the implied historical exchange ratios of shares\nof Great Plains common stock to shares of Microsoft common stock for the\naverage of the periods set forth below and for December 20, 2000, as follows:\n<TABLE>\n<CAPTION>\n                            Period                        Implied Exchange Ratio\n                            ------                        ----------------------\n     <S>                                                  <C>\n     Since IPO through December 20, 2000.................          .63\n     One year ended December 20, 2000....................          .55\n     Six months ended December 20, 2000..................          .48\n     Three months ended December 20, 2000................          .64\n     One month ended December 20, 2000...................          .85\n     December 20, 2000...................................          .85\n</TABLE>\n   The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and is not\nnecessarily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. Selecting\nportions of the analyses or of the summary set forth above, without considering\nthe analyses as a whole, could create an incomplete view of the processes\nunderlying Goldman Sachs\' opinion. In arriving at its fairness determination,\nGoldman Sachs considered the results of all these analyses and did not\nattribute any particular weight to any factor or analysis considered by it;\nrather, Goldman Sachs made its determination as to fairness on the basis of its\nexperience and professional judgment after considering the results of all of\nthese analyses. No company or transaction used in the above analyses is\ndirectly comparable to Great Plains or Microsoft or the merger.\n   The analyses were prepared solely for purposes of providing an opinion to\nthe Great Plains board of directors as to the fairness from a financial point\nof view to the stockholders of Great Plains of the exchange ratio to be\nreceived in connection with the merger. The analyses do not purport to be\nappraisals or necessarily reflect the prices at which businesses or securities\nactually may be sold. Analyses based upon forecasts of\n                                       34\n<PAGE>\nfuture results are not necessarily indicative of actual future results, which\nmay be significantly more or less favorable than those suggested by these\nanalyses. Because these analyses are inherently subject to uncertainty, being\nbased upon numerous factors or events beyond the control of the parties or\ntheir respective advisors, none of Great Plains, Microsoft, Goldman Sachs or\nany other person assumes responsibility if future results are materially\ndifferent from those forecast. As described above, the financial analyses\npresented by Goldman Sachs to the Great Plains board of directors was one of\nmany factors taken into consideration by the Great Plains board of directors in\nmaking its determination to approve the merger.\n   Goldman Sachs, as part of its investment banking business, is continually\nengaged in the valuation of businesses and their securities in connection with\nmergers and acquisitions, negotiated underwritings, competitive biddings,\nsecondary distributions of listed and unlisted securities, private placements\nand valuations for estate, corporate and other purposes. Goldman Sachs is\nfamiliar with Great Plains having provided investment banking services to Great\nPlains from time to time, including having made an $8.3 million principal\ninvestment in Great Plains in 1994 and having acted as:\n  . managing underwriter of its initial public offering of 3,000,000 shares\n    of common stock in March 1997;\n  . managing underwriter of its public offerings of 588,000 shares of common\n    stock in April 1998 and 2,000,000 shares of common stock in March 1999;\n    and\n  . its financial advisor in connection with, and having participated in\n    certain of the negotiations leading to, the merger agreement.\n   Goldman Sachs also has provided investment banking services to Microsoft\nfrom time to time, including having acted as:\n  . managing underwriter of its public offering of 10,954,616 shares of its\n    convertible exchangeable preferred stock in December 1996;\n  . its financial advisor in connection with its equity investment in Titus\n    Communications Corporation in April 2000; and\n  . managing underwriter of the initial public offering of 5,200,000 shares\n    of common stock of Expedia, Inc., a subsidiary of Microsoft, in November\n    1999.\n   Goldman Sachs provides a full range of financial advisory and securities\nservices and, in the course of its normal trading activities, may from time to\ntime effect transactions and hold positions in securities, including derivative\nsecurities, of Great Plains or Microsoft for its own account and for the\naccounts of customers.\n   Pursuant to a letter agreement dated October 20, 2000, as amended, Great\nPlains engaged Goldman Sachs to act as its financial advisor in connection with\na possible sale of Great Plains. Pursuant to the letter agreement, Great Plains\nhas agreed to reimburse Goldman Sachs for their reasonable out-of-pocket\nexpenses, including attorneys\' fees, and to indemnify Goldman Sachs against\nvarious liabilities, including liabilities under the federal securities laws.\nAlso pursuant to the terms of that letter agreement, Great Plains has agreed to\npay Goldman Sachs a transaction fee equal to the greater of (1) $8 million or\n(2) 0.9% of the total consideration paid in connection with a transaction,\nprovided that Great Plains will not pay an aggregate amount in excess of $11\nmillion. Under the letter agreement, total consideration is defined as the\namount paid for Great Plains\' equity securities (including amounts paid to\nholders of options, warrants and convertible securities) plus the principal\namount of Great Plains\' unpaid indebtedness for borrowed money as set forth on\nthe most recent consolidated balance sheet of Great Plains prior to the\nconsummation of a transaction.\nMicrosoft\'s reasons for the merger\n   Microsoft\'s board of directors has determined that the merger is in the best\ninterests of Microsoft and its shareholders. Microsoft\'s board of directors has\napproved the merger and the issuance of shares of Microsoft common stock in the\nmerger.\n                                       35\n<PAGE>\n   In reaching its determination, Microsoft\'s board of directors identified the\nfollowing reasons, among others, for entering into the merger agreement:\n  . Great Plains has built a strong business centered on delivering business\n    applications to small and medium-sized customers through a global network\n    of channel partners and Microsoft does not have a similar product\n    offering;\n  . The nature of Great Plains\' products and its customers creates a natural\n    complement to the Microsoft bCentral business;\n  . In the view of Microsoft\'s management, Great Plains\' future growth\n    prospects will be derived from accelerating small and medium business\n    efficiency and agility and by automating interconnected business\n    processes. The combination of Microsoft\'s Internet technology with Great\n    Plains\' domain expertise and application development capacity in business\n    management will create solutions that help companies realize this growth\n    potential; and\n  . The Great Plains indirect business model which focuses on offering\n    solutions through value added resellers is very compatible with\n    Microsoft\'s own business models and the Great Plains channel will provide\n    a more business focused distribution channel.\nStructure of the merger; completion and effectiveness of the merger\n   The merger agreement provides for the merger of Rubicon Acquisition\nCorporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of Microsoft, with and into Great\nPlains. Before the effective time of the merger, Microsoft, Rubicon and Great\nPlains will continue to be separate entities.\n   The merger will be completed when all of the conditions to completion of the\nmerger are satisfied or waived, including approval of the merger agreement by\nGreat Plains\' shareholders.\n   At the effective time of the merger, which occurs the day that articles of\nmerger and an agreement and plan of merger are filed with the Secretary of\nState of the states of Washington and Minnesota, Rubicon and Great Plains will\nmerge. Great Plains will survive the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of\nMicrosoft.\nMerger consideration; conversion of Great Plains common stock\n   At the effective time of the merger, each outstanding share of Great Plains\ncommon stock will be automatically converted into the right to receive 1.1\nshares of Microsoft common stock. The exchange ratio of 1.1 was determined\nthrough arm\'s-length negotiations between Microsoft and Great Plains. Up to\n25,792,235 shares of Microsoft common stock will be issued in the merger (based\non the number of shares of Great Plains common stock currently outstanding and\nassuming that all options to acquire Great Plains common stock that are\ncurrently outstanding and which will be exercisable as of September 30, 2001\nare exercised prior to the merger).\n   No fractional shares of Microsoft common stock will be issued in connection\nwith the merger. You will receive cash for any fractional share you would\notherwise receive in the merger. The amount of cash that Microsoft will pay you\nin lieu of a fractional share is equal to the average closing price of\nMicrosoft common stock on the Nasdaq Stock Market over the last twenty trading\ndays ending on the fifth trading day before the closing date, multiplied by the\nfraction of a share of Microsoft common stock to which you would otherwise be\nentitled. Great Plains shareholders will not receive interest on cash payments\nin lieu of fractional shares.\n   The conversion of Great Plains common stock into the right to receive\nMicrosoft common stock will occur automatically at the effective time of the\nmerger. At that time, all shares of Great Plains common stock will no longer be\noutstanding, will automatically be canceled and will cease to exist. Subject to\nthe dissenters\' rights described elsewhere in this proxy statement/prospectus,\neach holder of shares of Great Plains common stock will cease to have any\nrights as a shareholder except the right to receive the Microsoft common stock\ninto\n                                       36\n<PAGE>\nwhich those shares were converted in the merger and the right to receive cash\nfor any fractional share of Microsoft common stock.\nTreatment of options and employee stock purchase and benefit plans\n   At the effective time of the merger, each then-outstanding option to\npurchase shares of Great Plains common stock will be assumed by Microsoft and\nwill become an option to purchase shares of Microsoft common stock. The number\nof shares of Microsoft common stock for which the assumed option will be\nexercisable will be determined by multiplying the number of Great Plains shares\nsubject to the option by 1.1, and the per share exercise price will be\ndetermined by dividing the per share exercise price of the Great Plains option\nby 1.1 (rounded up to the nearest whole cent). To avoid options to purchase\nfractional shares, the number of shares of Microsoft common stock subject to an\nassumed option will be rounded down to the nearest whole share. The other terms\nof the assumed Great Plains options (other than those held by non-employee\ndirectors), including exercisability and vesting schedules, will remain\nunchanged.\n   Microsoft has agreed to use good faith efforts to ensure that Great Plains\noptions which qualified as ""incentive stock options"" as defined by the Internal\nRevenue Code prior to the merger will qualify as incentive stock options for\nMicrosoft common stock after the merger. Great Plains options that do not\nqualify as incentive stock options will convert into options for Microsoft\ncommon stock that are similarly non-qualified.\n   Microsoft intends to issue the shares of Microsoft common stock issuable\nupon the exercise of assumed Great Plains options under Microsoft\'s 2001 Stock\nPlan, which is subject to a currently effective registration statement on Form\nS-8 filed with the SEC. Alternatively, Microsoft may file a registration\nstatement with the SEC to register the shares of Microsoft common stock to be\nissued upon exercise of the assumed Great Plains options. Microsoft will use\nits best efforts to maintain the effectiveness of the applicable registration\nstatement for as long as any assumed Great Plains options remain outstanding.\nMicrosoft will use commercially reasonable best efforts to give holders of\nsubstituted Microsoft options notice of their new options as soon as\npracticable after the effective time of the merger.\n   In accordance with the provisions of the FRx 1999 Stock Option/Stock\nIssuance Plan (which was assumed by Great Plains in its acquisition of FRx\nSoftware Corporation on March 2, 2000), vesting of options granted under that\nplan will accelerate if, within one year following the FRx acquisition, an\noption holder\'s employment terminates for reasons not attributable to the\noption holder.\n   Certain options granted under Great Plains\' stock option plans accelerate\nfollowing a change in control of Great Plains if those options are not assumed\non the same terms and conditions. Because all options under these plans will be\nassumed by Microsoft on the same terms, acceleration of options under these\nplans will not occur.\n   Immediately before the effective time of the merger, Great Plains will\nterminate or modify according to Microsoft\'s direction Great Plains\' stock\npurchase plan. This termination will not result in any loss of rights for those\nemployees who purchased stock or have already been granted options or other\nawards under the plan. On the date of the termination of the plan, all funds\nthat have been withheld from the wages of Great Plains employees for the\npurchase of Great Plains common stock under the plan will be applied to a final\npurchase under the Great Plains stock purchase plan. Following the closing,\nMicrosoft intends that Great Plains employees will be eligible to participate\nin Microsoft\'s employee stock purchase plan subject to the eligibility\nrequirements set forth in that plan.\n   After completion of the merger, Microsoft has the right to require Great\nPlains to modify or terminate its other employee benefits plans; however, it is\ncurrently anticipated that Great Plains will maintain its own separate non-\nstock based benefits plans for the immediate future, without modification.\nInterests of Great Plains\' directors, executive officers and certain employees\nin the merger\n   When considering the recommendation of Great Plains\' board of directors, you\nshould be aware that some of Great Plains\' directors and executive officers\nhave interests in the merger and have arrangements that are\n                                       37\n<PAGE>\ndifferent from, or are in addition to, their interests as shareholders of Great\nPlains generally. These include, among other things, indemnification rights and\nother benefits and payments under certain agreements and employee benefit and\nretention plans.\n  . Nonemployee directors. Microsoft does not plan to retain any nonemployee\n    directors of Great Plains following completion of the merger.\n    Accordingly, pursuant to the terms of the Great Plains Outside Directors\n    Stock Plan, all stock options held by directors granted under this plan\n    will accelerate upon the completion of the merger. These directors will\n    receive no other benefits in connection with the merger.\n  . Indemnification. Microsoft has agreed that if the merger is completed,\n    all rights to indemnification (including payment of litigation expenses)\n    of current or former directors, officers and employees of Great Plains\n    and its subsidiaries arising from actions taken before the consummation\n    of the merger, under Minnesota law and Great Plains\' articles of\n    incorporation and bylaws, will be assumed by Microsoft, continue in full\n    force and effect for six years from the effective date of the merger and\n    be guaranteed by Microsoft.\n  . Employment offer letters. Microsoft has agreed to issue offer letters to\n    the following officers and senior administrative employees of Great\n    Plains who might otherwise have been adversely affected by a business\n    combination:\n<TABLE>\n<CAPTION>\n     Name:             Title:\n     -----             ------\n     <C>               <S>\n     Coulombe, David   Vice President of Strategy and Planning\n     Edson, David      Vice President of Finance and Controller\n     Erdle, Dennis     Senior Vice President of U.S. Operations\n     Herman, Doug      General Counsel\n     Laybourn, Darren  Executive Vice President of Products\n     O\'Hara, David     Executive Vice President of International Operations and\n                       Business Development\n     Olsen, Michael    Senior Vice President, Corporate Communications\n     Reller, Tami      Chief Financial Officer\n     Robertson, Bonnie Vice President of Organizational Development\n     Slette, Michael   Vice President of Human Resources\n     Uecker-Rust, Jodi Chief Operating Officer\n     Young, Jeffrey    Executive Vice President of Global Operations\n</TABLE>\n      Under the terms of these offer letters, employment of these officers\n   and employees of Great Plains will continue following the merger and they\n   will receive the same salary and bonus compensation as they do prior to\n   the merger. In addition to their existing options to acquire Great Plains\n   common stock that will be assumed by Microsoft in the merger, these\n   persons, along with all other Great Plains employees, will be eligible to\n   receive new-hire grants of options to acquire Microsoft common stock\n   under Microsoft\'s 2001 Stock Plan. The number of new stock options\n   offered would be similar to the number Microsoft typically grants to\n   other new Microsoft employees performing comparable work. The offer\n   letters also provide that, upon termination of the employee without cause\n   within twenty-four months after the merger, the employee will be entitled\n   to receive a payment equal to the greater of the employee\'s annual base\n   salary plus annual incentive compensation bonuses paid at 100% of goal\n   (excluding special compensation such as stock-based compensation) at the\n   time of such termination or the date of the announcement of the merger.\n   The offer letters replace the right to certain payments which would have\n   been due under pre-existing employment arrangements with these officers\n   and employees that would otherwise be triggered upon (i) a change in\n   control of Great Plains, and (ii) termination of employment.\n  . Doug Burgum. Microsoft intends to offer employment to Doug Burgum, Great\n    Plains\' chairman and chief executive officer, on substantially the same\n    terms and conditions as his current employment. Doug Burgum will be\n    president of the Great Plains Division and a Microsoft senior vice\n    president.\n                                       38\n<PAGE>\n  . Stock ownership. Under the terms of the merger agreement, at the time the\n    merger is completed, each outstanding share of Great Plains common stock\n    will be automatically converted into the right to receive 1.1 shares of\n    Microsoft common stock. As of [      ], 2001, the record date,\n    collectively Great Plains\' directors and executive officers beneficially\n    owned 4,639,335 shares, or approximately [22.9%], of Great Plains\'\n    outstanding common stock (not including options, which are described\n    below).\n  . Stock options. Under the terms of the merger agreement, at the time the\n    merger is completed, each outstanding option to purchase shares of Great\n    Plains common stock issued to employees and directors of Great Plains\n    will be assumed by Microsoft and will become an option to purchase shares\n    of Microsoft common stock. The terms of an assumed Great Plains option\n    held by a Great Plains employee or officer will not be affected by the\n    merger, except that the number of shares subject to the option and the\n    exercise price per share will be adjusted to reflect the exchange ratio.\n    The terms of an assumed Great Plains option held by a non-employee\n    director will be affected by the merger to the extent that these options\n    must be exercised within ninety days following the merger.\n      As of the record date, directors and executive officers of Great\n   Plains collectively held outstanding options to purchase [     ] shares\n   of Great Plains common stock. Of these options, [    ] were vested as of\n   the record date.\n   Great Plains\' board of directors was aware of and considered these interests\nin approving the merger agreement and recommending that Great Plains\'\nshareholders approve the merger agreement.\nRestrictions on sales by affiliates of Great Plains and Microsoft\n   All shares of Microsoft common stock received by Great Plains shareholders\nin connection with the merger will be freely transferable unless the\nshareholder is considered an affiliate of either Great Plains or Microsoft\nunder the Securities Act.\n   Each Great Plains affiliate agreed that he or she will sell, offer to sell\nor otherwise dispose of any Microsoft common stock issued in connection with\nthe merger only under an effective registration statement or in compliance with\nRule 145 or other exemption from registration under the Securities Act.\nMicrosoft has agreed to use its reasonable efforts to permit affiliate sales\nunder Rule 145 and Rule 144 and to file all reports required to be filed under\nthe Securities Exchange Act of 1934.\nMaterial United States federal income tax consequences of the merger\n   It is a condition to the merger that Great Plains and Microsoft each receive\nan opinion from their respective tax counsel that the merger will constitute a\nreorganization under Section 368 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as\namended, and that Microsoft, the wholly owned subsidiary of Microsoft and Great\nPlains will each be a party to that reorganization. Great Plains will receive\nan opinion of its tax counsel, Dorsey & Whitney LLP, as to certain federal\nincome tax consequences of the merger to Great Plains shareholders and\nMicrosoft will receive an opinion of its tax counsel, Preston Gates & Ellis\nLLP, as to certain federal income tax consequences of the merger. The Internal\nRevenue Service has not been and will not be asked to rule upon the tax\nconsequences of the merger.\n   The opinions of Dorsey & Whitney LLP and Preston Gates & Ellis LLP will be\nbased upon the facts described herein and various representations and covenants\nmade by Microsoft and Great Plains and will also be subject to various\nassumptions and qualifications. The opinions of Dorsey & Whitney LLP and\nPreston Gates & Ellis LLP will be based upon the Internal Revenue Code,\nexisting and proposed Treasury regulations, current administrative rulings and\npractice and judicial authority, all of which are subject to change, possibly\nwith retroactive effect. Unlike a ruling from the Service, an opinion of\ncounsel is not binding on the Internal Revenue Service and there can be no\nassurance, and none is given in this Proxy Statement/Prospectus, that the\n                                       39\n<PAGE>\nService will not take a position contrary to one or more positions reflected\nherein or that the opinions will be upheld by the courts if challenged by the\nService.\n   The following is only a general description of certain anticipated federal\nincome tax consequences of the merger, without regard to the particular\ncircumstances of each shareholder of Great Plains. It does not discuss all of\nthe consequences that may be relevant to Great Plains shareholders subject to\nspecial treatment under the Internal Revenue Code (such as insurance companies,\ndealers in securities, exempt organizations or foreign persons) or to\nshareholders of Great Plains who acquired their Great Plains common stock in\nconnection with employee stock options, stock purchase plans or otherwise as\ncompensation. The following summary does not purport to be a complete analysis\nof all potential tax effects of the transactions contemplated by the merger\nagreement or the merger itself. No information is provided herein with respect\nto the tax consequences, if any, of the merger under state, local or foreign\ntax laws.\n   Each holder of Great Plains common stock is urged to consult his or her own\ntax advisor as to the federal income tax consequences of the merger, and also\nas to any state, local, foreign or other tax consequences based on his or her\nown particular facts and circumstances.\n   Assuming the merger qualifies as a tax-free reorganization, the following\nfederal income tax consequences will result from the merger:\n  . Great Plains, Microsoft and the wholly owned merger subsidiary of\n    Microsoft will each be a party to the reorganization within the meaning\n    of Section 368(b) of the Internal Revenue Code.\n  . No income, gain or loss will be recognized by Great Plains or Microsoft\n    as a result of the consummation of the merger.\n  . No gain or loss will be recognized by the holders of Great Plains common\n    stock upon the exchange of Great Plains common stock solely for Microsoft\n    common stock pursuant to the merger, except to the extent of cash\n    received in lieu of fractional shares of Microsoft common stock or in\n    connection with the exercise of dissenters\' rights.\n  . The basis of the Microsoft common stock received by a shareholder of\n    Great Plains pursuant to the merger, including any fractional shares\n    deemed received as described below, will be the same as the basis of the\n    Great Plains common stock surrendered in exchange therefor.\n  . The holding period of the Microsoft common stock received by a\n    shareholder of Great Plains pursuant to the merger will include the\n    period during which the Great Plains common stock surrendered therefor\n    was held, provided the Great Plains common stock is a capital asset in\n    the hands of the Great Plains shareholder at the time of the merger.\n  . Cash payments made to a holder of Great Plains common stock in lieu of\n    fractional shares of Microsoft common stock will be treated as if a\n    fractional share of Microsoft common stock had been issued pursuant to\n    the merger and then redeemed by Microsoft. A holder of Great Plains\n    common stock receiving cash in lieu of fractional shares will generally\n    recognize gain or loss equal to the difference between the shareholder\'s\n    basis in the fractional share and the amount of cash received. This gain\n    or loss will be capital gain or loss provided the Great Plains common\n    stock was a capital asset in the hands of the Great Plains shareholder at\n    the time of the merger.\n  . Cash payments made to a holder of Great Plains common stock who exercises\n    dissenters\' rights will be treated as distributions in redemption of the\n    shareholder\'s Great Plains common stock. A holder of Great Plains common\n    stock receiving cash in connection with the exercise of dissenters\'\n    rights will recognize either: (1) gain or loss equal to the difference\n    between the cash received and the holder\'s basis in the Great Plains\n    common stock; or (2) dividend income, depending upon whether the deemed\n    redemption qualifies for sale or exchange treatment under the tests set\n    forth in Section 302 of the Code. Gain or loss will be capital gain or\n    loss provided the Great Plains common stock was a capital asset in the\n    hands of the Great Plains shareholder at the time of the merger.\n                                       40\n<PAGE>\nAccounting treatment of the merger\n   The merger will be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Microsoft will be\ndeemed the acquiror for financial reporting purposes. Under the purchase method\nof accounting, the purchase price in the merger is allocated among the Great\nPlains assets acquired, including identifiable intangibles, and the Great\nPlains liabilities assumed to the extent of their fair market value, with any\nexcess purchase price being allocated to goodwill.\nRegulatory filings and approvals required to complete the merger\n   Under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended,\ncertain acquisition transactions, including the merger, cannot be consummated\nunless specified information has been furnished to the Federal Trade Commission\nand the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice and\nspecific waiting period requirements have been satisfied. On January 19, 2001,\neach of Microsoft and Great Plains made the required premerger notification\nfilings with the Federal Trade Commission and the Antitrust Division of the\nDepartment of Justice. Under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act, the merger may not be\nconsummated until the expiration of at least thirty days following the receipt\nof the Notifications under the Act, unless the waiting period is earlier\nterminated by the FTC and the Antitrust Division or extended by the issuance of\na request for additional information and documents.\n   The FTC and the Antitrust Division are charged with enforcing antitrust laws\nconcerning transactions such as the merger. At any time before or after the\nconsummation of the merger, the FTC or the Antitrust Division could take such\naction under the antitrust laws as it deems appropriate, including seeking to\nenjoin the consummation of the merger or seeking the divestiture of assets of\nGreat Plains or Microsoft. Great Plains and Microsoft believe that the proposed\nmerger does not violate the antitrust laws. However, a challenge to the merger\non antitrust grounds could be made. If such a challenge is made, it is\nuncertain what the results would be. Due to the international scope of\nMicrosoft\'s and Great Plains\' businesses, regulatory filings will also be\nrequired in certain European and other jurisdictions. Microsoft and Great\nPlains do not expect those non-U.S. filings to affect the timing of the merger.\nOther than as described in this paragraph and the filing of the actual merger\ndocuments with the Secretary of State of the states of Washington and\nMinnesota, Microsoft and Great Plains believe that the merger does not require\nthe approval of any U.S. federal, state or other agency.\nExchange of Great Plains stock certificates for Microsoft stock certificates\n   Within fifteen days after the closing of the merger, Microsoft will send a\nletter of transmittal to all former Great Plains shareholders. In order to\nexchange Great Plains common stock for Microsoft common stock, you must deliver\nthe letter of transmittal to the exchange agent, Mellon Investor Services LLC.\nTo be effective, the letter of transmittal must be properly completed, signed\nand submitted to the exchange agent in the return envelope mailed with the\nletter of transmittal and accompanied by (a) the certificates as to which the\nexchange is proposed to be made or (b) an appropriate guarantee of delivery of\nthe certificates from a firm that is a member of a registered national\nsecurities exchange or of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.,\nor a commercial bank or trust company having an office or correspondent in the\nUnited States, provided that you do in fact deliver the certificates to the\nexchange agent within three Nasdaq trading days after the date the guarantee of\ndelivery is executed.\n   Microsoft has the reasonable discretion, which it may delegate in whole or\nin part to the exchange agent, to determine whether any letter of transmittal\nhas been properly completed, signed and submitted or revoked and to disregard\nimmaterial defects in the form of election or letter of transmittal. The\nexchange agent will make those computations contemplated by the merger\nagreement, and, in the absence of manifest error, all such computations will be\nconclusive and binding on the holders of Great Plains common stock.\n   As soon as practicable after receipt of your properly completed letter of\ntransmittal, the exchange agent will deliver to you a certificate representing\nthe appropriate number of shares of Microsoft common stock, together with a\ncheck representing the cash payment for any fractional share.\n                                       41\n<PAGE>\nListing of Microsoft common stock; delisting and deregistration of Great Plains\ncommon stock\n   If the merger is completed, Microsoft is obligated to use commercially\nreasonable best efforts to cause the shares of Microsoft common stock that will\nbe issued in connection with the merger, and the shares of Microsoft common\nstock that will be issued on exercise of assumed Great Plains options, to be\nquoted on the Nasdaq Stock Market or listed on the same national securities\nexchange as Microsoft common stock is then listed. Great Plains common stock\nwill be delisted from the Nasdaq Stock Market and will be deregistered under\nthe Exchange Act.\nOperations after the merger\n   After the merger, Great Plains will continue to operate as the Great Plains\nDivision of Microsoft, reporting jointly to Jeff Raikes, group vice president\nof Microsoft\'s Productivity and Business Services Group, and David Vaskevitch,\nsenior vice president of the Business Application Division at Microsoft. The\nBusiness Productivity and Business Service Group is charged with delivering\nbusiness productivity solutions that empower knowledge workers. The Business\nApplication Division is engaged in developing and delivering a core set of\nbusiness management software applications and Internet services to small and\nmedium size businesses.\n   Doug Burgum, Great Plains\' chairman and chief executive officer, will be\npresident of the Great Plains Division and a Microsoft senior vice president.\n                                       42\n<PAGE>\n                              THE MERGER AGREEMENT\n   This section of the proxy statement/prospectus describes the merger\nagreement.

In addition, Great\nPlains has agreed that, except as previously disclosed to Microsoft, neither it\nnor any of its subsidiaries will, without the prior written consent of\nMicrosoft:\n  . alter or accelerate any exercisability, vesting or similar provisions of\n    stock option or benefit plans or authorize cash payments in exchange for\n    awards under those plans, except in the ordinary course of business;\n  . grant any severance pay to any officer, director or employee, except in\n    the ordinary course consistent with past practice;\n  . except in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practices,\n    transfer to any outside person or entity any rights to Great Plains\'\n    intellectual property;\n  . enter into or amend any agreement granting a third party exclusive\n    marketing or manufacturing rights;\n  . commence or settle any claim, action or proceeding, except in the\n    ordinary course of business or in immaterial amounts and except for\n    specified types of lawsuits;\n  . enter into leases that extend beyond December 21, 2002 and obligate Great\n    Plains to pay aggregate gross rent in excess of $1 million;\n  . extend any offers of employment for a position of vice president or\n    higher;\n  . declare or pay any dividends or make any other distributions with respect\n    to its capital stock, split or reclassify its capital stock, issue or\n    authorize the issuance of any other securities in respect of or in\n    substitution for its capital stock, or repurchase or otherwise acquire\n    any of its capital stock other than repurchasing vested stock from former\n    employees;\n  . issue or agree to issue any capital stock, options, warrants, calls,\n    conversion rights or other similar securities, subject to certain limited\n    exceptions;\n  . accelerate any options to acquire Great Plains stock;\n  . amend its corporate charter documents;\n  . acquire or agree to acquire any corporation, partnership or other\n    business organization or assets that are material to Great Plains\'\n    business condition;\n  . dispose of any assets, except in the ordinary course of business or in\n    immaterial amounts;\n  . incur material indebtedness;\n  . enter into or materially amend any material employee benefit plans or,\n    except in the ordinary course of business, enter into employment\n    agreements or increase employee remuneration; or\n  . settle any material claims, actions or proceedings.\n   In addition, Great Plains has agreed that it will:\n  . call a special meeting of Great Plains shareholders for the consideration\n    and approval of the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by\n    the merger agreement;\n  . provide Microsoft with such information for inclusion in this proxy\n    statement/prospectus and the related registration statement as Microsoft\n    may reasonably request;\n  . without the loss of any vested benefits but without accelerating any\n    unvested rights (except as required by law), terminate or modify any\n    employee benefit plans as directed by Microsoft immediately before the\n    effective time of the merger or take such action as may be directed by\n    Microsoft to merge those plans with Microsoft employee benefit plans at\n    the effective time of the merger; and\n                                       46\n<PAGE>\n  . promptly file all tax returns and pay all taxes required to be filed or\n    paid before the closing of the merger.\n   Microsoft has agreed that it will:\n  . use its commercially reasonable best efforts to cause the shares of\n    Microsoft common stock to be issued in connection with the merger and\n    upon the exercise of assumed Great Plains options to be quoted at the\n    effective time on the Nasdaq Stock Market or listed on the same national\n    exchange as Microsoft common stock is listed; and\n  . implement certain compensation and bonus arrangements for Great Plains\n    employees following the merger. See ""Interests of Great Plains\' directors\n    and executive officers in the merger"" on page 37.\nExclusivity\n   Great Plains has agreed that, subject to limited exceptions, it will not,\nand will use its commercially reasonable best efforts to ensure that none of\nits officers, directors, agents, representatives or affiliates will not, take\nor cause or permit any subsidiary to take any of the following actions with any\nparty other than Microsoft:\n  . solicit, encourage, initiate or participate in any negotiations,\n    inquiries or discussions regarding any offer or proposal to acquire all\n    or a significant part of Great Plains\' or its subsidiaries\' business,\n    assets or capital shares;\n  . enter into any agreement related to an acquisition of all or a\n    significant part of Great Plains\' or its subsidiaries\' business, assets\n    or capital shares;\n  . authorize or announce any public statement, recommendation or\n    solicitation in support of an acquisition of all or a significant part of\n    Great Plains\' or its subsidiaries\' business, assets or capital shares; or\n  . disclose any customarily nonpublic information about Great Plains in\n    connection with an acquisition of all or a significant part of Great\n    Plains\' or its subsidiaries\' business, assets or capital shares.\n   However, Great Plains\' board of directors may recommend to shareholders that\nthey tender their shares in connection with a tender offer by an acquiror other\nthan Microsoft if the board determines in good faith and after consultation\nwith legal counsel that its fiduciary duty to its shareholders so requires. In\naddition, the board may give information to a third party who has made an\nunsolicited acquisition proposal that the board reasonably believes is\nfinancially more favorable to Great Plains and its shareholders than the merger\nwith Microsoft, as long as Great Plains notifies Microsoft three business days\nbefore furnishing the information. Great Plains will promptly inform Microsoft\nof any inquiry or proposal that it receives with respect to an acquisition\ntransaction or any request by any person for nonpublic information concerning\nGreat Plains or any of its subsidiaries, and will provide Microsoft with the\nmaterial facts relating to the offer, proposal or request, including the\nidentity of the third party making the inquiry or proposal. After that\nnotification, Great Plains is obligated to inform Microsoft of additional\nmaterial facts as they arise and to provide Microsoft with any additional\ninformation Great Plains gives to the third party.\nTermination of the merger agreement\n   Even if Great Plains\' shareholders approve the merger agreement, the merger\nagreement may be terminated by the mutual agreement of the parties at any time\nbefore the effective time of the merger. In addition, the merger agreement may\nbe terminated by either Great Plains or Microsoft under any of the following\ncircumstances:\n  . if the terminating party is not in material breach of any representation,\n    warranty, covenant or agreement and the other party breaches a\n    representation, warranty, covenant or agreement in the merger agreement,\n    if the breach has a material adverse effect on the business of the non-\n    breaching party or on the benefits of the merger and the breach has not\n    been cured or best efforts are not being employed to cure the breach\n    within twenty days after notice is given to the breaching party;\n                                       47\n<PAGE>\n  . if the merger has not been consummated before September 30, 2001 (subject\n    to extension until March 31, 2002 if Great Plains and Microsoft have\n    agreed to pursue litigation against any administrative or judicial action\n    or proceeding challenging the merger on the basis that it violates\n    antitrust law);\n  . if Great Plains shareholders have voted on but not approved the merger\n    agreement;\n  . if there exists an administrative or judicial action or proceeding\n    challenging the merger on the basis that it violates antitrust law and\n    either party determines that it is not in its best interest to contest or\n    resist the proceeding; or\n  . if any permanent injunction or other order preventing the merger has\n    become final and non-appealable.\n   In addition, Microsoft may terminate the merger agreement if:\n  . Great Plains\' board of directors withdraws or modifies, in a manner\n    adverse to Microsoft, its approval or recommendation of the merger; or\n  . Great Plains or its representatives take any action prohibited by the\n    exclusivity provisions of the merger agreement.\nTermination fees\n   Microsoft has agreed to pay Great Plains a termination fee of $40 million if\nGreat Plains is not then in material breach of the merger agreement and Great\nPlains terminates the agreement as a result of a material breach by Microsoft\nof its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements and that breach has\nnot been cured or Microsoft is not using its best efforts to cure the breach\nwithin twenty days after notice is given to Microsoft.\n   Great Plains has agreed to pay Microsoft a termination fee of $40 million if\nMicrosoft is not then in material breach of the merger agreement and Microsoft\nterminates the agreement for any of the following reasons:\n  . Great Plains\' board of directors has withdrawn or modified, in a manner\n    adverse to Microsoft, its approval or recommendation of the merger;\n  . Great Plains or its representatives have taken any action prohibited by\n    the provisions of the merger agreement regarding potential acquisitions\n    of Great Plains by parties other than Microsoft;\n  . Great Plains has entered an agreement with any person other than\n    Microsoft to a transaction that will result in a change in the beneficial\n    ownership of more than 50% of the voting power of Great Plains capital\n    stock before or within twelve months after the termination of the merger\n    agreement; or\n  . Great Plains has materially breached its representations, warranties,\n    covenants or agreements in the merger agreement and that breach has not\n    been cured or Great Plains is not using its best efforts to cure the\n    breach within twenty days after notice is given to Great Plains.\n   The termination fee from Great Plains may increase the likelihood of the\ncompletion of the merger in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement.\nThe termination fee may also discourage persons from making an offer to acquire\nall of or a significant interest in Great Plains by increasing the cost of an\nacquisition.\n   In addition, Microsoft has agreed to pay Great Plains a termination fee of\n$5 million if\n  . the required antitrust approvals have not been obtained before September\n    30, 2001 (subject to extension until March 31, 2002 if Great Plains and\n    Microsoft have agreed to pursue litigation against any administrative or\n    judicial action or proceeding challenging the merger on the basis that it\n    violates antitrust law); or\n                                       48\n<PAGE>\n  . either party terminates the agreement as a result of an administrative or\n    judicial action or proceeding challenging the merger on the basis that it\n    violates antitrust law and that party determines that it is not in its\n    best interest to contest or resist the proceeding.\nExtension; waiver\n   At any time before the effective time of the merger, any party to the merger\nagreement may, to the extent legally allowed, extend the time for the\nperformance of any other party\'s obligations under the merger agreement, waive\nany inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of any other party in\nthe merger agreement or related documents and waive compliance with any of the\nagreements, conditions or covenants in the merger agreement that are for the\nbenefit of the waiving party.\nAmendments\n   The merger agreement may be amended by Microsoft and Great Plains at any\ntime before or after approval by Great Plains\' shareholders, except that, after\nshareholder approval, Great Plains and Microsoft may not make any amendment\nthat by law requires the further approval of Great Plains\' shareholders without\nobtaining that approval.\n                                       49\n<PAGE>\n                               RELATED AGREEMENTS\n   This section of the proxy statement/prospectus describes agreements related\nto the merger agreement, including the Great Plains management voting\nagreements and letters of Great Plains affiliates. While we believe that these\ndescriptions cover the material terms of these agreements, these summaries may\nnot contain all of the information that is important to you. You should read\nthe related agreements, which are attached to this proxy statement/prospectus\nor filed as an exhibit to the registration statement filed by Microsoft with\nthe SEC, of which this proxy statement/prospectus is a part.\nGreat Plains management voting agreements\n   As a condition to the merger agreement, Microsoft required Great Plains\'\ndirectors and executive officers to enter into voting agreements. These voting\nagreements require, without any additional consideration, Great Plains\'\ndirectors and executive officers to vote all of the shares of Great Plains\ncommon stock they beneficially own in favor of the merger. As of [      ],\n2001, the record date, Great Plains\' directors and executive officers\ncollectively held the power to vote [    ] shares of Great Plains common stock,\nwhich represented approximately [22.9]% of Great Plains\' outstanding common\nstock. In connection with the agreement, Great Plains\' directors and executive\nofficers granted an irrevocable proxy to the directors of Microsoft, giving the\nMicrosoft directors the right to vote the shares covered by the voting\nagreement as described above.\n   The voting agreement will expire on the earlier of the termination of the\nmerger agreement in accordance with its terms or the completion of the merger.\nAffiliate letters\n   Each Great Plains affiliate also agreed that he or she will sell, offer to\nsell or otherwise dispose of any Microsoft common stock issued in connection\nwith the merger only under an effective registration statement or in compliance\nwith Rule 145 or other exemption from registration under the Securities Act.\nMicrosoft has agreed to use its reasonable efforts to permit affiliate sales\nunder Rule 145 and Rule 144 and to file all reports required to be filed under\nthe Securities Exchange Act of 1934.\n                                       50\n<PAGE>\n                COMPARISON OF RIGHTS OF HOLDERS OF GREAT PLAINS\n                    COMMON STOCK AND MICROSOFT COMMON STOCK\n   After completion of the merger, the holders of Great Plains common stock\nwill become shareholders of Microsoft. Before the merger, the rights of\nshareholders of Great Plains are governed by Minnesota law, Great Plains\'\narticles of incorporation and Great Plains\' bylaws. After the merger, as\nMicrosoft shareholders, their rights will be governed by Washington law and\nMicrosoft\'s articles of incorporation and bylaws, as those documents currently\nexist or may exist in the future.\n   The following discussion summarizes the material differences between the\nrights of holders of Microsoft common stock and holders of Great Plains common\nstock under the articles of incorporation and bylaws of Microsoft and Great\nPlains. This summary is not complete and is qualified in its entirety by\nreference to Microsoft\'s articles of incorporation and bylaws, Great Plains\'\narticles of incorporation and bylaws and the relevant provisions of Washington\nand Minnesota law. Copies of the charter documents are attached as exhibits to\nGreat Plains\' and Microsoft\'s filings with the SEC. See ""Documents incorporated\nby reference into this proxy statement/prospectus"" on page 65 and ""Where you\ncan find more information"" on page 66.\n   Although Washington and Minnesota corporation laws currently in effect are\nsimilar in many respects, certain differences will affect the rights of the\nCompany\'s shareholders if the merger is consummated. The following discussion\nsummarizes certain differences considered by management to be significant and\nis qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Minnesota\nBusiness Corporation Act and the Washington Business Corporation Act.\nAnti-Takeover Legislation\n   Both Minnesota and Washington law contain provisions intended to protect\nshareholders from individuals or companies attempting a takeover of a\ncorporation in certain circumstances. The anti-takeover provisions of the laws\nof Minnesota and Washington differ in a number of respects, and it is not\npractical to summarize all of those differences here. However, the following is\na summary of certain significant differences.\n   Control Share Acquisition. The Minnesota control share acquisition statute,\nSection 302A.671 of the Minnesota Business Corporation Act, establishes various\ndisclosure and shareholder approval requirements to be met by individuals or\ncompanies attempting a takeover of an ""issuing public corporation"" such as\nGreat Plains. Washington has no comparable provision. However, Great Plains has\nelected not to be governed by this statute through Great Plains\' articles of\nincorporation in accordance with Section 302A.671.\n   Business Combinations. While there is no Washington statute comparable to\nSection 302A.671 of the Minnesota Business Corporation Act, both Minnesota and\nWashington have business combination statutes that are intended primarily to\ndeter highly leveraged takeover bids which propose to use the target\'s assets\nas collateral for the offeror\'s debt financing or to liquidate the target, in\nwhole or in part, to satisfy financing obligations.\n   The Minnesota statute, Section 302A.673 of the Minnesota Business\nCorporation Act, provides that an issuing public corporation such as Great\nPlains may not engage in certain business combinations with any person that\nbecomes an interested shareholder by acquiring beneficial ownership of 10% or\nmore of the voting stock of that corporation for a period of four years\nfollowing the date that the person became an interested shareholder unless,\nprior to that date, a committee of the corporation\'s disinterested directors\napprove either the business combination or the acquisition of shares.\n   Only defined types of ""business combinations"" are prohibited by the\nMinnesota statute. In general, the definition includes: any merger or exchange\nof securities of the corporation with the interested shareholder; certain\nsales, transfers or other disposition of assets of the corporation to an\ninterested shareholder; transfers by\n                                       51\n<PAGE>\nthe corporation to interested shareholders of shares that have a market value\nof 5% or more of the value of all outstanding shares, except for a pro rata\ntransfer made to all shareholders; any liquidation or dissolution of, or\nreincorporation in another jurisdiction of, the corporation which is proposed\nby the interested shareholder; certain transactions proposed by the interested\nshareholder or any affiliate or associate of the interested shareholder that\nwould result in an increase in the proportion of shares entitled to vote owned\nby the interested shareholder and transactions whereby the interested\nshareholder receives the benefit of loans, advantages, guarantees, pledges or\nother financial assistance or tax advances or credits from the corporation.\n   For purposes of selecting a committee, a director or person is\n""disinterested"" under the Minnesota Statute if the director or person is\nneither an officer nor an employee, nor has been an officer or employee within\nfive years preceding the formation of the committee of the issuing public\ncorporation, or of a related corporation. The committee must consider and act\non any written, good faith proposal to acquire shares or engage in a business\ncombination. The committee must consider and take action on the proposal and\nwithin thirty days render a decision in writing regarding the proposal.\n   In contrast to the Minnesota provisions, Washington law (Chapter 19 of the\nWashington Business Corporation Act) prohibits a ""target corporation,"" with\ncertain exceptions, from engaging in certain ""significant business\ntransactions"" (such as a merger or sale of assets) with an ""acquiring person""\nwho acquires 10% or more of the voting securities of a target corporation for a\nperiod of five years after such acquisition, unless the transaction is approved\nby a majority of the members of the target corporation\'s board of directors\nprior to the date of the acquisition. Target corporations include domestic\ncorporations with a class of voting shares registered with the Securities and\nExchange Commission pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the\n""Exchange Act""). Foreign corporations required to have a certificate of\nauthority to transact business in Washington are also subject to the statute\nif: (i) the corporation has a class of voting shares registered with the SEC\npursuant to the Exchange Act; (ii) its principal executive office is located in\nWashington; (iii) (A) more than 10% of its shareholders of record resident in\nWashington, (B) more than 10% of its shares are owned by Washington residents\nor (C) one thousand or more shareholders of record reside in Washington; (iv) a\nmajority of its employees, together with those of its subsidiaries, are\nresidents of Washington, or the corporation, together with its subsidiaries,\nemploys more than one thousand residents in Washington and (v) a majority of\nthe corporation\'s tangible assets, together with those of its subsidiaries, are\nlocated in Washington or the corporation and its subsidiaries have more than\n$50 million worth of tangible assets in Washington. A target corporation that\nmeets the definition may not ""opt out"" of this statute.\n   Only certain ""significant business transactions"" are prohibited under\nWashington law. A significant business transaction is defined broadly to\ninclude any of the following: (i) any merger or consolidation with the\nacquiring person; (ii) any sale, transfer or other disposition of assets to the\nacquiring person if the assets have a market value equal to or greater than 5%\nof the aggregate market value of all of the corporation\'s assets; (iii) the\ntermination of 5% or more of the employees of the target corporation employed\nin Washington; (iv) any issuance, transfer or redemption of shares, options,\nwarrants or rights to acquire shares of the corporation to the acquiring\nperson, except for transfers in a conversion or exchange or a pro rata\ndistribution; (v) the liquidation or dissolution of a target corporation\nproposed by or pursuant to an agreement with the acquiring person; (vi) a\nreclassification of securities involving, proposed by or pursuant to an\nagreement with an acquiring person or (vii) any receipt by the acquiring person\nof any loans, advances, guarantees, pledges and other financial benefits.\n   In both Minnesota and Washington, an interested shareholder or acquiring\nperson is one who owns 10% of the outstanding shares, and in both states, a\nperson is deemed to beneficially own shares which that person has the right to\nacquire pursuant to the exercise of stock options, warrants or other rights. An\nacquiring person must wait five years in Washington to engage in prohibited\nbusiness combinations, while the waiting period is only four years in\nMinnesota. Washington also has a potentially broader definition of a business\ncombination, which encompasses a larger variety of transactions.\n                                       52\n<PAGE>\n   Under both statutes, an otherwise prohibited business combination may be\npermitted only by advance board or board committee approval. In addition, the\nWashington statute provides that if the corporation proposes a merger or sale\nof assets, or does not oppose a tender offer, all acquiring persons are\nreleased from the five year prohibition and may compete with the company-\nsponsored transaction in certain circumstances. The Minnesota statute does not\nhave a comparable provision.\n   Under both Minnesota and Washington law, covered corporations may not opt\nout of the business combination statute.\n   Other Anti-Takeover Provisions. The Minnesota Business Corporation Act\nincludes three other provisions that may be applicable in the takeover context\nthat are not included in the Washington Business Corporation Act. These\nprovisions address a corporation\'s use of golden parachutes, greenmail and the\nstandard of conduct of the board of directors in connection with the\nconsideration of takeover proposals.\n   Section 302A.255, Subdivision 3, of the Minnesota Business Corporation Act\nprohibits a publicly-held corporation from entering into or amending agreements\n(commonly referred to as ""golden parachutes"") that increase current or future\ncompensation of any officer or director during any tender offer or request or\ninvitation for tenders.\n   Section 302A.553, Subdivision 3, of the Minnesota Business Corporation Act\nlimits the ability of a corporation to repurchase shares at a price above\nmarket value (commonly referred to as ""greenmail""). The statute provides that a\npublicly-held corporation is prohibited from purchasing or agreeing to purchase\nany shares from a person who beneficially owns more than 5% of the voting power\nof the corporation if the shares had been beneficially owned by that person for\nless than two years, and if the purchase price would exceed the market value of\nthose shares. However, such a purchase will not violate the statute if the\npurchase is approved at a meeting of the shareholders by a majority of the\nvoting power of all shares entitled to vote or if the corporation makes an\noffer of at least equal value per share to all holders of shares of the class\nor series and to all holders of any class or series into which the securities\nmay be converted.\n   Section 302A.251, Subdivision 5, of the Minnesota Business Corporation Act\nauthorizes the board of directors, in considering the best interests of the\ncorporation (including with respect to a proposed acquisition of an interest in\nthe corporation), to consider the interest of the corporation\'s employees,\ncustomers, suppliers and creditors, the economy of the state and nation,\ncommunity and social considerations and the long-term as well as short-term\ninterests of the corporation and its shareholders, including the possibility\nthat these interests may be best served by the continued independence of the\ncorporation.\nDirectors\' Standard of Care and Personal Liability\n   Both the Minnesota Business Corporation Act and the Washington Business\nCorporation Act provide that a director shall discharge the director\'s duties\nin good faith, in a manner the director reasonably believed to be in the best\ninterests of the corporation and with the care an ordinarily prudent person in\na like position would have exercised under similar circumstances. A director\nwho so performs those duties may not be held liable by reason of being a\ndirector or having been a director of the corporation.\nLimitation or Elimination of Directors\' Personal Liability\n   The Minnesota Business Corporation Act provides that, if the articles of\nincorporation so provide, the personal liability of a director for breach of\nfiduciary duty as a director may be eliminated or limited, but that the\narticles may not limit or eliminate such liability for (a) any breach of the\ndirector\'s duty of loyalty to the corporation or its shareholders, (b) acts or\nomissions not in good faith or that involve intentional misconduct or a knowing\nviolation of law, (c) the payment of unlawful dividends, stock repurchases or\nredemptions, (d) any transaction in which the director received an improper\npersonal benefit, (e) certain violations of the Minnesota securities laws and\n(f) any act or omission occurring prior to the date when the provision in the\narticles\n                                       53\n<PAGE>\neliminating or limiting liability becomes effective. Great Plains\' articles of\nincorporation contain a provision eliminating the personal liability of its\ndirectors for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director,\nsubject to the foregoing limitations, and specifying that any repeal or\nmodification of these limits on director liability may not adversely affect any\nright or protection of a director existing at the time of such repeal or\nmodification.\n   The Washington Business Corporation Act provides that the Articles of\nIncorporation may not eliminate or limit the liability of a director for: (i)\nacts or omissions involving intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of\nlaw; (ii) approval of certain distributions contrary to law or (iii) any\ntransaction from which the director personally receives a benefit in money,\nproperty or services to which the director is not legally entitled. In\nMicrosoft\'s Articles of Incorporation, these limits on director liability are\ndeemed to be contract rights that are to be automatically amended as authorized\nby changes in applicable law so that the liability of a director shall be\neliminated or limited to the fullest extent not prohibited by applicable law,\nand any repeal or modification of the relevant provision of Microsoft\'s\nArticles of Incorporation shall not adversely affect any right or protection of\na director of Microsoft with respect to any acts or omissions of such director\noccurring prior to such repeal or modification. Neither the Minnesota Business\nCorporation Act nor the Washington Business Corporation Act limit a director\'s\nliability for violation of certain federal laws including the federal\nsecurities laws.\nIndemnification\n   Except as limited by a corporation\'s articles of incorporation or bylaws,\nthe Minnesota Business Corporation Act generally provides for mandatory\nindemnification of persons acting in an official capacity on behalf of the\ncorporation if such a person acted in good faith, received no improper personal\nbenefit, acted in a manner the person reasonably believed to be in or not\nopposed to the best interest of the corporation, and, in the case of a criminal\nproceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe that the conduct was unlawful.\nGreat Plains\' bylaws provide for indemnification to the full extent provided by\nMinnesota law.\n   Microsoft\'s Articles of Incorporation provide that Microsoft shall indemnify\nits directors and officers for expenses and liabilities incurred by them as a\nresult of their service as directors and officers, provided that no such\nindemnification shall be provided on account of: (i) acts or omissions of the\ndirector or officer finally adjudged to be intentional misconduct or a knowing\nviolation of the law; (ii) approval of certain distributions contrary to law or\n(iii) any transaction with respect to which the director or officer is finally\nadjudged to have received a benefit to which he or she was not legally\nentitled. This comprehensive language is intended to provide the broadest\nindemnification of directors and officers not prohibited by Washington law, and\nto authorize indemnification of directors and officers of amounts paid in\nsettlement of actions brought on behalf of Microsoft, commonly known as\nderivative actions.\n   Microsoft\'s Board of Directors believes that the potential personal\nliability that can result from derivative actions arising out of an\nindividual\'s service as a director or officer of a corporation is a major\nconcern for individuals who are asked to serve in such positions. Microsoft\'s\nBoard of Directors has concluded that by providing indemnification to\nMicrosoft\'s directors and officers for amounts paid in settlement of derivative\nactions, subject to the restrictions set forth in the Washington Business\nCorporation Act, Microsoft will be able to effectively maintain its ability to\nrecruit and retain individuals who possess the qualities and experience\nnecessary to serve as directors and officers of Microsoft.\n   Microsoft is not aware of any pending or threatened litigation to which the\nabove-described limitation of directors\' liability would apply.\nShareholder Voting\n   Under Minnesota law, action on certain matters, including the sale, lease or\nexchange of all or substantially all of the corporation\'s property or assets,\nmergers and consolidations and voluntary dissolution, must be approved by the\naffirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of all shares\nentitled\n                                       54\n<PAGE>\nto vote. Washington law provides, however, that unless specified to the\ncontrary in the articles of incorporation, the affirmative vote of two-thirds\nof all votes entitled to be cast is required for approval in the case of a\nmerger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of its assets not in\nthe ordinary course of its business or dissolution, instead of a simple\nmajority, which is the Minnesota requirement. Microsoft\'s Articles of\nIncorporation provide that only a majority of votes entitled to be cast is\nrequired for approval of a merger, share exchange, sale of substantially all of\nMicrosoft\'s assets or dissolution.\nAppraisal Rights in Connection with Corporate Reorganizations and Other Actions\n   Under Minnesota law and Washington law, shareholders have the right, in some\ncircumstances, to dissent from certain corporate transactions by demanding\npayment in cash for their shares equal to the fair value as determined by\nagreement with the corporation or by a court in an action timely brought by the\ndissenters. Both laws generally afford dissenters\' rights upon certain\namendments to the articles that materially and adversely affect the rights or\npreferences of the shares of the dissenting shareholder, upon the sale of\nsubstantially all corporate assets and upon merger or exchange by a\ncorporation, regardless of whether the shares of the corporation are listed on\na national securities exchange or widely held. See ""Rights of Dissenting Great\nPlains Shareholders"" on page 59.\nCumulative Voting for Directors\n   Minnesota law provides that each shareholder entitled to vote for directors\nhas the right to cumulate those votes in the election of directors by giving\nwritten notice of intent to do so, unless the corporation\'s articles of\nincorporation provide otherwise. Great Plains\' articles of incorporation\nprohibit such accumulation of votes in elections of directors. Under Washington\nlaw, no such cumulative voting exists, unless the certificate of incorporation\nprovides otherwise. Microsoft\'s Articles of Incorporation do not provide for\ncumulative voting in elections of directors.\nConflicts of Interest\n   Under Minnesota law, a contract or transaction between a corporation and one\nor more of its directors, or an entity in or of which one or more of the\ncorporation\'s directors are directors, officers or legal representatives or\nhave a material financial interest, is not void or voidable solely by reason of\nthe conflict, provided that (i) the contract or transaction is fair and\nreasonable at the time it is authorized, approved or ratified, (ii) the\nmaterial facts of the contract or transaction are fully disclosed to or known\nby the shareholders and approved by (a) the holders of two-thirds of the voting\npower of shares entitled to vote held by disinterested shareholders or (b) the\nunanimous affirmative vote of all shareholders, whether or not entitled to\nvote, (iii) it is authorized in good faith by a majority of the disinterested\nmembers of the board of directors holding a quorum after disclosure of the\nrelationship or interest or (iv) the contract or transaction is a merger\napproved in accordance with the Minnesota Business Corporation Act.\n   The Washington Business Corporation Act sets forth a safe harbor for\ntransactions between a corporation and one or more of its directors. A\nconflicting interest transaction may not be enjoined, set aside or give rise to\ndamages if: (i) it is approved by a majority of qualified directors; (ii) it is\napproved by the affirmative vote of all qualified shares or (iii) at the time\nof commitment, the transaction was fair to the corporation. For purposes of\nthis provision, ""qualified director"" is one who does not have: (a) a\nconflicting interest respecting the transaction or (b) a familial, financial,\nprofessional or employment relationship with a second director which\nrelationship would reasonably be expected to exert an influence on the first\ndirector\'s judgment when voting on the transaction. ""Qualified shares"" are\ndefined generally as shares other than those beneficially owned, or the voting\nof which is controlled, by a director who has a conflicting interest respecting\nthe transaction.\nClassified Board of Directors\n   Both Minnesota and Washington permit a corporation\'s articles or bylaws to\nprovide for a classified board of directors. Washington permits electing one or\nmore directors by the holders of one or more specified classes\n                                       55\n<PAGE>\nor series of shares. In addition, the statute permits staggered terms for\ndirectors, up to a maximum of three separate groups. Minnesota law does not\nlimit the number of classes. Great Plains\' bylaws provide for a classified\nboard of directors under which directors are elected to three-year terms, with\none-third of the directors being elected each year. Microsoft\'s articles and\nbylaws do not provide for election of directors by class or series or in\nstaggered terms.\nRemoval of Director\n   Under Minnesota and Washington law, in general, unless a corporation\'s\narticles provide otherwise, a director may be removed with or without cause by\nthe affirmative vote of a majority of the shareholders. Under Minnesota law,\nthe bylaws may also establish a different standard for removal of directors.\nGreat Plains\' bylaws provide that in order for the shareholders to remove a\ndirector it must be for cause and by the affirmative vote of a majority of the\nshareholders holding a majority of the shares entitled to vote at an election\nof directors. A director named by the board of directors to fill a vacancy may\nbe removed from office at any time, with or without cause, by the affirmative\nvote of the remaining directors if the shareholders have not elected directors\nin the interim between the time of the appointment to fill the vacancy and the\ntime of the removal.\nVacancies on Board of Directors\n   Under Minnesota law, unless the articles or bylaws provide otherwise, (a) a\nvacancy on a corporation\'s board of directors may be filled by the vote of a\nmajority of directors then in office, although less than a quorum; and (b) a\nnewly created directorship resulting from an increase in the number of\ndirectors may be filled by the board. Any director so elected shall hold office\nonly until a qualified successor is elected at the next regular or special\nmeeting of shareholders.\n   Under Washington law, a vacancy on a corporation\'s board of directors may be\nfilled by a majority of the remaining directors, even if less than a quorum, or\nby the affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding voting shares, unless\notherwise provided in the articles of incorporation or bylaws. A newly created\ndirectorship, resulting from an increase in the number of directors, may be\nfilled by the board. A director\'s term continues until the next annual\nshareholders\' meeting.\nAnnual Meetings of Shareholders\n   Minnesota law provides that if a regular meeting of shareholders has not\nbeen held during the immediately preceding fifteen months, a shareholder or\nshareholders holding 3% or more of the voting power of all shares entitled to\nvote may demand a regular meeting of shareholders. Washington law provides that\nthe corporation shall hold meetings at a time stated or fixed in the bylaws.\nMicrosoft\'s Bylaws provide that the annual meeting be held at a time and date\nwithin 150 days of the end of the fiscal year, to be determined by the board or\nan authorized committee of the board.\nSpecial Meetings of Shareholders\n   Minnesota law and Great Plains\' bylaws provide that the chief executive\nofficer, the chief financial officer, two or more directors, a person\nauthorized in the articles or bylaws to call a special meeting or a shareholder\nholding 10% or more of the voting power of all shares entitled to vote, may\ncall a special meeting of the shareholders, except that a special meeting\nconcerning a business combination must be called by 25% of the voting power of\nall shares entitled to vote. Under Washington law, the board of directors or\nthose persons authorized by the corporation\'s articles of incorporation or\nbylaws may call a special meeting of the corporation\'s shareholders, as well as\nshareholders holding 10% of the voting power. Under Washington law, the right\nof shareholders of a public company to call a special meeting may be limited by\nthe articles of\n                                       56\n<PAGE>\nincorporation. Microsoft\'s articles of incorporation provide that special\nmeetings are to be held only upon notice given by the board of directors.\nVoluntary Dissolution\n   Minnesota law provides that a corporation may be dissolved by the voluntary\naction of holders of a majority of a corporation\'s shares entitled to vote at a\nmeeting called for the purpose of considering such dissolution. Washington law\nprovides that voluntary dissolution of a corporation first must be deemed\nadvisable by a majority of the board of directors and then approved by two-\nthirds of the outstanding shares entitled to vote (or a lesser vote as stated\nin articles, but not less than a majority.)\nInvoluntary Dissolution\n   Minnesota law provides that a court may dissolve a corporation in an action\nby a shareholder where: (a) the situation involves a deadlock in the management\nof corporate affairs and the shareholders cannot break the deadlock; (b) the\ndirectors have acted fraudulently, illegally or in a manner unfairly\nprejudicial to the corporation; (c) the shareholders are divided in voting\npower for two consecutive regular meetings to the point where successor\ndirectors are not elected; (d) there is a case of misapplication or waste of\ncorporate assets or (e) the duration of the corporation has expired. Washington\nlaw does not have a parallel provision.\nInspection of Shareholder Lists\n   Under Minnesota law, a shareholder, beneficial owner or a holder of a voting\ntrust certificate of a publicly held corporation has, upon written demand\nstating the purpose and acknowledged or verified by a notary public or by other\nproper means under Minnesota law, a right at any reasonable time to examine and\ncopy the corporation\'s share register and other corporate records reasonably\nrelated to the stated purpose and described with reasonable particularity in\nthe written demand upon demonstrating the stated purpose to be a proper\npurpose. The acknowledged or verified demand must be directed to the\ncorporation at its registered office in Minnesota or at its principal place of\nbusiness. A proper purpose is one reasonably related to the person\'s interest\nas a shareholder, beneficial owner or a holder of a voting trust certificate of\nthe corporation. Under Washington law, any shareholder has an absolute right,\nupon written demand, to examine and copy, in person or by a legal\nrepresentative, at any reasonable time, the corporation\'s share register.\nAmendment of the Bylaws\n   Minnesota law provides that, unless reserved by the articles to the\nshareholders, the power to adopt, amend or repeal a corporation\'s bylaws is\nvested in the board, subject to the power of the shareholders to adopt, amend\nor repeal the bylaws. After adoption of initial bylaws, the board of a\nMinnesota corporation cannot adopt, amend or repeal a bylaw fixing a quorum for\nmeetings of shareholders, prescribing procedures for removing directors or\nfilling vacancies in the board or fixing the number of directors or their\nclassifications, qualifications or terms of office, but may adopt or amend a\nbylaw to increase the number of directors. Washington law provides that either\nthe board or shareholders may amend the bylaws.\nAmendment of the Articles\n   Under Minnesota law, before the shareholders may vote on an amendment to the\narticles of incorporation, either a resolution to amend the articles must have\nbeen approved by the affirmative vote of the majority of the directors present\nat the meeting where such resolution was considered or the amendment must have\nbeen proposed by shareholders holding 3% or more of the voting power of the\nshares entitled to vote. Amending the articles of incorporation requires the\naffirmative vote of the holders of the majority of the voting power present and\nentitled to vote at the meeting (and of each class, if entitled to vote as a\nclass), unless the articles of incorporation require a larger proportion.\nMinnesota law provides that a proposed amendment may be voted upon by the\nholders of a class or series even if the articles of incorporation would deny\nthat right, if among other things, the proposed amendment would increase or\ndecrease the aggregate number of authorized shares of\n                                       57\n<PAGE>\nthe class or series, change the rights or preferences of the class or series,\ncreate a new class or series of shares having rights and preferences prior and\nsuperior to the shares of that class or series or limit or deny any existing\npreemptive right of the shares of the class or series.\n   The Washington Business Corporation Act authorizes a corporation\'s board of\ndirectors to make various changes to its articles of incorporation without\nshareholder approval including changes of corporate name, changes of the number\nof outstanding shares necessary to effectuate a stock split or stock dividend\nin the corporation\'s own shares and changes of the par value of its shares.\nOther amendments to a corporation\'s articles of incorporation must be\nrecommended to the shareholders by the board of directors, unless the board\ndetermines that because of a conflict of interest or other special\ncircumstances it should make no recommendation and communicates the basis for\nits determination to the shareholders with the amendment. For the amendment to\nbe adopted, it must be approved by a majority of all votes entitled to be cast\nby each voting group that has a right to vote on the amendment.\nProxies\n   Both Minnesota law and Washington law permit proxies of definite duration.\nIn the event the proxy does not specify its duration, under both Minnesota and\nWashington law it is valid for eleven months. Under Minnesota and Washington\nlaw, no appointment of a proxy is irrevocable unless the appointment is coupled\nwith an interest in the shares or in the corporation.\nPreemptive Rights\n   Under both Minnesota and Washington law, shareholders have preemptive rights\nto acquire a certain fraction of the unissued securities or rights to purchase\nsecurities of a corporation before the corporation may offer them to other\npersons, unless the corporation\'s articles of incorporation otherwise provide.\nGreat Plains\' articles of incorporation provide that no such preemptive right\nexists in Great Plains\' shareholders. Microsoft\'s articles of incorporation\nprovide that Microsoft\'s shareholders have no preemptive rights.\nDividends\n   Generally, under both Minnesota and Washington law, a corporation may pay a\ndividend if its board determines that the corporation will be able to pay its\ndebts in the ordinary course of business after paying the dividend and if,\namong other things, the dividend payment does not reduce the remaining net\nassets of the corporation below the aggregate preferential amount payable in\nthe event of liquidation to the holders of the shares having preferential\nrights, unless the payment is made to those shareholders in the order and to\nthe extent of their respective priorities.\nShareholders\' Action Without a Meeting\n   Under both Minnesota and Washington law, any action required or permitted to\nbe taken at a shareholders\' meeting may be taken without a meeting by written\nconsent signed by all of the shareholders entitled to vote on such action. This\npower can be restricted by a Washington corporation\'s articles. Microsoft\'s\narticles of incorporation do not restrict such shareholder action without a\nmeeting.\nStock Repurchases\n   A Minnesota corporation may acquire its own shares if, after the\nacquisition, it is able to pay its debts as they become due in the ordinary\ncourse of business and if enough value remains in the corporation to satisfy\nall preferences of senior securities. Under Washington law, a corporation may\npurchase or redeem shares of any class so long as the purchase does not (a)\nimpair the corporation\'s ability to pay its debts as they become due in the\nordinary course of business, or (b) cause its total assets to become less than\nits total liabilities (plus, unless the corporation\'s articles of incorporation\nprovide otherwise, preferential rights of senior securities).\n                                       58\n<PAGE>\n                 RIGHTS OF DISSENTING GREAT PLAINS SHAREHOLDERS\n   The following is a brief summary of the rights of holders of Great Plains\ncommon stock to dissent from the merger and receive cash equal to the ""fair\nvalue"" of their Great Plains common stock instead of receiving shares of\nMicrosoft common stock. This summary is not exhaustive, and you should read\nSections 320A.471 and 302A.473 of the Minnesota Business Corporation Act, which\nare attached to this proxy statement/prospectus as Annex C.\n   If you are contemplating the possibility of dissenting from the merger, you\nshould carefully review the text of Annex C, particularly the procedural steps\nrequired to perfect dissenters\' rights, which are complex. You should also\nconsult your legal counsel. If you do not fully comply with the procedural\nrequirements of the statute, you will lose your dissenters\' rights.\nWho may exercise appraisal rights\n   Under Minnesota law, shareholders of Great Plains have the right, by fully\ncomplying with the applicable provisions of Sections 301A.471 and 302A.473, to\ndissent with respect to the merger and to receive from Great Plains payment in\ncash for the ""fair value"" of their shares after the merger is completed. The\nterm ""fair value"" means the value of the shares immediately before the\neffective time of the merger and may be less than, equal to or greater than the\nmarket price of the Microsoft common stock to be issued to nondissenting\nshareholders for their Great Plains common stock if the merger is consummated.\n   All references in this summary to a ""shareholder"" or ""you"" are to a\nshareholder of Great Plains as of [      ], 2001, the record date for the\nspecial meeting. A person having beneficial ownership of shares that are held\nof record in the name of another person, such as a broker, nominee, trustee or\ncustodian, must act promptly to cause the record holder to follow the steps\nsummarized below in a proper and timely manner if the beneficial owner wishes\nto perfect any dissenters\' rights.\nRequirements for exercising appraisal rights\n   Shareholders who desire to exercise their dissenters\' rights must:\n  . file a written notice of intent to demand fair value for his, her or its\n    shares with Great Plains before the shareholder vote is taken to approve\n    the merger agreement. This written demand must be in addition to and\n    separate from any proxy or vote against approval of the merger agreement;\n  . not vote his, her or its shares in favor of the merger agreement; and\n  . follow the statutory procedures for perfecting dissenters\' rights, which\n    are described below.\n   If you do not satisfy all of these conditions, you cannot exercise\ndissenters\' rights and will be bound by the terms of the merger agreement.\nVoting against, abstaining from voting or failing to vote to approve the merger\nagreement does not constitute a demand for appraisal within the meaning of\nMinnesota law.\n   A shareholder\'s failure to vote against the approval of the merger agreement\nwill not constitute a waiver of dissenter\'s appraisal rights. However, if a\nshareholder returns a signed proxy but does not specify a vote against approval\nof the merger agreement or direction to abstain, the proxy will be voted for\napproval of the merger agreement, and the shareholder\'s dissenter\'s appraisal\nrights will be waived.\n   A shareholder must assert dissenters\' rights with respect to all of the\nshares registered in the holder\'s name except where certain shares are\nbeneficially owned by another person but registered in the holder\'s name. If a\nrecord owner, such as a broker, nominee, trustee or custodian, wishes to\ndissent with respect to shares beneficially owned by another person, the\nshareholder must dissent with respect to all of the beneficial owner\'s shares\nand must disclose the name and address of the beneficial owner on whose behalf\ndissent is made. Also, a\n                                       59\n<PAGE>\nbeneficial owner of shares who is not the record owner of those shares may\nassert dissenters\' rights as to the shares held on that person\'s behalf,\nprovided that the beneficial owner submits a written consent from the record\nowner to Great Plains at or before the time the dissenters\' rights are\nasserted.\n   Notices of intent to exercise dissenters\' rights should be filed with Great\nPlains at: Great Plains Software, Inc., 1701 S.W. 38th Street, Fargo, ND 58103,\nAttn: General Counsel.\nAppraisal procedure\n   After the proposed merger has been approved by the shareholders at the\nspecial meeting, Great Plains will send written notice to all shareholders who\nhave given written notice under the dissenters\' rights provisions and have not\nvoted in favor of the merger as described above. The notice will contain:\n  . the address where the demand for payment and certificates representing\n    shares of Great Plains common stock must be sent and the date by which\n    they must be received;\n  . any restrictions on transfer of uncertificated shares that will apply\n    after the demand for payment is received;\n  . a form for demanding payment that requires certification of the date the\n    shareholder, or the beneficial owner on whose behalf the shareholder\n    dissents, acquired the Great Plains common stock or an interest in it;\n    and\n  . a copy of sections 302A.471 and 302A.473 of the Minnesota Business\n    Corporation Act, attached hereto as Annex C, and a brief description of\n    the procedures to be followed under those provisions.\n   If you wish to assert dissenters\' rights and receive the fair value of your\nshares, you must demand payment, deposit your certificates with Great Plains\nand provide any other related information specified in the notice from Great\nPlains, within thirty days after the notice is given. If you fail to make\ndemand for payment and deposit your certificates within the thirty-day period,\nyou will lose the right to receive fair value for your shares under the\ndissenters\' rights provisions, even if you filed a timely notice of intent to\ndemand payment.\n   Except as provided below, after the later of the effective time of the\nmerger or Great Plains\' receipt of a valid demand for payment, Great Plains\nwill remit to each dissenting shareholder who complied with the requirements of\nthe Minnesota Business Corporation Act the amount Great Plains estimates to be\nthe fair value of the shareholder\'s Great Plains common stock, with interest\nstarting five days after the effective time of the merger at a rate prescribed\nby statute. Great Plains will include the following information with the\npayment:\n  . Great Plains\' closing balance sheet and statement of income for the\n    fiscal year ending no more than sixteen months before the effective date\n    of the merger, together with the latest available interim financial\n    statement;\n  . Great Plains\' estimate of the fair value of the shares and a brief\n    description of the method used to reach that estimate;\n  . a copy of Sections 302A.471 and 302A.473 of the Minnesota Business\n    Corporation Act (attached hereto as Annex C); and\n  . a brief description of the procedures to be followed in demanding\n    supplemental payment.\n   Great Plains may withhold payment for any person who was not a shareholder\non December 21, 2000, the date the merger was first announced to the public, or\nwho is dissenting on behalf of a person who was not a beneficial owner on that\ndate. If the dissenter has complied with the procedures described above, Great\nPlains shall send a statement to the dissenter setting forth the above\ninformation as well as the reason for withholding the remittance and an offer\nto pay to the dissenter the estimate of the fair value of the shares, with\ninterest, as a final settlement of the dissenting shareholder\'s demand for\npayment.\n                                       60\n<PAGE>\n   If you are dissatisfied with your payment or offer, you may, within thirty\ndays of the payment or offer for payment, notify Great Plains in writing of and\ndemand payment of your estimate of the fair value of your shares plus interest,\nto the extent that your estimate exceeds Great Plains\' payment or offer. Within\nsixty days after receipt by Great Plains of any dissenting shareholder\'s demand\nfor supplemental payment, Great Plains shall either pay to the dissenter the\nsupplemental amount demanded or agreed to by the dissenter after discussion\nwith Great Plains or file a petition in court requesting that the court\ndetermine the fair value of the shares, plus interest. The petition shall be\nfiled in Hennepin County, Minnesota, and shall name as parties all dissenting\nshareholders whose demands remain unsettled.\n   The court may appoint one or more appraisers to receive evidence and make\nrecommendations to the court as to the amount of the fair value of the shares.\nThe court shall determine whether the shareholder or shareholders in question\nhave fully complied with the requirements of this section, and shall determine\nthe fair value of the shares, taking into account any and all factors the court\nfinds relevant, computed by any method or combination of methods that the\ncourt, in its discretion, sees fit to use, whether or not used by Great Plains\nor by a dissenter. The fair value of the shares as determined by the court is\nbinding on all dissenting shareholders. If the court determines that the fair\nvalue of the shares is in excess of any amount remitted by Great Plains, then\nthe court will enter a judgment for cash in favor of the dissenting\nshareholders in an amount by which the value determined by the court, plus\ninterest, exceeds the amount previously remitted.\n   The court will determine the costs and expenses of the court proceeding,\nincluding the reasonable expenses and compensation of any appraisers appointed\nby the court, and assess them against Great Plains, except that the court may\nassess part or all of the costs against any dissenting shareholders whose\nactions in demanding supplemental payments are found by the court to be\narbitrary, vexatious or not in good faith. If the court finds that Great Plains\ndid not substantially comply with the relevant provisions of section 302A.473\nof the Minnesota Business Corporation Act, the court may also assess against\nGreat Plains any fees and expenses of attorneys or experts that the court deems\nequitable. The court may also assess those fees and expenses against any party\nif the court finds that the party has acted arbitrarily, vexatiously or not in\ngood faith in bringing the proceedings. The court may award, in its discretion,\nfees and expenses of an attorney for the dissenting shareholders out of the\namount awarded to the shareholders, if it finds the services of the attorney\nwere of substantial benefit to the other dissenting shareholders and that those\nfees should not be assessed against Great Plains.\n   Under subdivision 4 of Section 302A.471 of the Minnesota Business\nCorporation Act, a shareholder has no right, at law or in equity, to set aside\nthe approval of the merger agreement except if the approval is fraudulent with\nrespect to that shareholder or Great Plains.\n                                       61\n<PAGE>\n                   SHARE OWNERSHIP OF PRINCIPAL SHAREHOLDERS,\n                    MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS OF GREAT PLAINS\n   The following table provides information concerning the beneficial ownership\nof Great Plains common stock as of [      ], 2001, the record date, for the\nfollowing:\n  . each person or entity who is known by Great Plains to beneficially own\n    more than 5% of the outstanding shares of Great Plains common stock;\n  . each of Great Plains\' current directors;\n  . Great Plains\' chief executive officer and its five other executive\n    officers; and\n  . all of Great Plains\' directors and executive officers as a group.\n   This table includes percentage ownership data reflecting ownership both\nbefore and after consummation of the merger with Microsoft. The pre-merger\npercentage ownership is based on [       ] shares of Great Plains common stock\noutstanding as of the record date. The post-merger percentage ownership\nincludes only the [    ] shares of Microsoft common stock that would be issued\nto Great Plains shareholders based on the [    ] shares of Great Plains common\nstock outstanding as of the record date.

Subject to the provisions of this\nAgreement, Sub will be merged into Company (the ""Merger""). An Agreement and\nPlan of Merger and articles, certificates or other appropriate filing documents\n(the ""Merger Documents"") shall be duly prepared, executed and acknowledged by\nthe parties and thereafter delivered to the Secretaries of State of Minnesota\nand Washington, for filing, as provided in the Minnesota Business Corporation\nAct (the ""MBCA"") and the Washington Business Corporation Act (the ""WBCA"") as\nsoon as practicable on or after the Closing Date. The Merger shall become\neffective upon the acceptance for filing of the Merger Documents by the\nSecretaries of State of Minnesota and Washington or at such time thereafter as\nis provided in the Merger Documents (the ""Effective Time""). Company\nacknowledges and agrees that Microsoft will have no obligation to make any\npayment or issue any securities pursuant to this Agreement until such filings\nhave been confirmed in writing.\n   1.2 Closing. The closing of the Merger (the ""Closing"") will take place as\nsoon as practicable but no later than the fifth business day after satisfaction\nor waiver of the last to be fulfilled of the conditions set forth in Article\nVII that by their terms are not to occur at the Closing (the ""Closing Date""),\nat the offices of Preston Gates & Ellis LLP, Seattle, Washington, unless\nanother date or place is agreed to in writing by the parties hereto.\n   1.3 Effects of the Merger. At the Effective Time, (i) the separate existence\nof Sub shall cease and Sub shall be merged with and into Company (Company after\nthe Merger is sometimes referred to herein as the ""Surviving Corporation""),\n(ii) the Articles of Incorporation of Company shall be the Articles of\nIncorporation of the Surviving Corporation, except that such Articles of\nIncorporation shall be amended to provide that the authorized capital stock of\nthe Surviving Corporation shall be 1,000 shares of Common Stock, $.01 par value\n(""Surviving Corporation\'s Common Stock""), until duly amended, (iii) the Bylaws\nof Sub shall be the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation, (iv) the directors and\nofficers of the Surviving Corporation shall be designated by Microsoft prior to\nthe Closing, and (v) the Merger shall, from and after the Effective Time, have\nall the effects provided by applicable law.\n   1.4 Tax-Free Reorganization. The Merger is intended to be a reorganization\nwithin the meaning of Section 368 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as\namended (the ""Code""), and this Agreement is intended to be a ""plan of\nreorganization"" within the meaning of the regulations promulgated under Section\n368 of the Code. Each party hereto agrees to treat the Merger as a\nreorganization within the meaning of Section 368 of the Code, and agrees to\ntreat this Agreement as a ""plan of reorganization"" within the meaning of the\nregulations promulgated under Section 368 of the Code, unless and until there\nis a determination, within the meaning of Section 1313 of the Code, that such\ntreatment is not correct. Each party hereto agrees to act in good faith\nconsistent with the intent of the parties and the intended treatment of the\nMerger as set forth in this Section 1.4.\n                                      A-1\n<PAGE>\n                                   ARTICLE II\n                EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE CAPITAL STOCK OF THE\n               CONSTITUENT CORPORATIONS; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES\n   2.1 Effect on Capital Stock. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the\nMerger and without any action (except as provided in Section 4.8 and in this\nSection) on the part of the holder of any shares of Company common stock, par\nvalue $0.01 per share (""Company Common Shares""):\n     2.1.1 Capital Stock of Sub. All issued and outstanding shares of capital\n  stock of Sub shall continue to be issued and shall be converted into 1,000\n  shares of Surviving Corporation Common Stock with the stock certificate of\n  Sub evidencing ownership of such shares of capital stock of the Surviving\n  Corporation.\n     2.1.2 Cancellation of Company Common Stock. All Company Common Shares\n  that are owned directly or indirectly by Company or Microsoft or by any\n  Subsidiary of Company or Microsoft shall be canceled and no stock of\n  Microsoft or other consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.\n  For purposes of this Agreement, ""Subsidiary"" or ""Subsidiaries"" shall mean\n  an entity of which, an amount of the voting securities, or other voting\n  ownership or voting partnership interests of which is sufficient to elect a\n  majority of its board of directors or other governing body (or, if there\n  are no such interests, 50% or more of the equity interests of which) is\n  owned directly or indirectly by Company. Unless otherwise expressly stated\n  or implied by context, all references to Company shall include each of\n  Company\'s Subsidiaries.\n     2.1.3 Conversion of Company Common Stock. Each Company Common Share\n  issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than\n  Dissenting Shares, as such term is defined in Section 2.1.8, shall, by\n  virtue of the Merger, be converted into the right to receive 1.1 shares\n  (the ""Exchange Ratio"") of common stock, par value $0.0000125 per share, of\n  Microsoft (the ""Microsoft Common Shares"") (the ""Merger Consideration""). All\n  such Company Common Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall cease\n  to exist, and each certificate (a ""Certificate"") previously representing\n  any such shares shall represent only the right to receive (i) whole shares\n  of Microsoft Common Shares and (ii) cash in lieu of fractional shares, in\n  each case as provided by this Section 2.1.\n     2.1.4 Adjustments of Exchange Ratio. If, between the date of this\n  agreement and the Effective Time, the outstanding Microsoft Common Shares\n  or Company Common Shares shall have been changed into a different number of\n  shares or a different class or series or otherwise changed by reason of any\n  reclassification, recapitalization, split-up, stock dividend, stock\n  combination, exchange of shares or readjustment or similar transaction, the\n  Exchange Ratio shall be correspondingly adjusted.\n     2.1.5 Dissenters\' Rights. Notwithstanding any provision of this\n  Agreement to the contrary, each outstanding Company Common Share, the\n  holder of which has demanded and perfected such holder\'s right to dissent\n  from the Merger and to be paid the fair value of such shares in accordance\n  with Sections 302A.471 et seq. of the MBCA and, as of the Effective Time,\n  has not effectively withdrawn or lost such dissenters\' rights (""Dissenting\n  Shares""), shall not be converted into or represent a right to receive the\n  Merger Consideration into which Company Common Shares are converted\n  pursuant to Section 2.1.3 hereof, but the holder thereof shall be entitled\n  only to such rights as are granted by the MBCA. Company shall give\n  Microsoft (i) prompt written notice of any notice of intent to demand fair\n  value for any Company Common Shares, withdrawals of such notices, and any\n  other instruments served pursuant to the MBCA or any other provisions of\n  Minnesota law and received by the Company, and (ii) to the extent it can\n  lawfully do so, the opportunity to conduct jointly all negotiations and\n  proceedings with respect to demands for fair value for Company Common\n  Shares under the MBCA. Company shall not, except with the prior written\n  consent of Microsoft, voluntarily make any payment with respect to any\n  demands for fair value for Company Common Shares or offer to settle or\n  settle any such demands. To the extent possible, any amounts paid to\n  holders of Company Common Stock in respect of Dissenting Shares shall be\n  paid out of assets held by the Company immediately prior to the Effective\n  Time. If, before the\n                                      A-2\n<PAGE>\n  Effective Time, such holder fails to perfect or loses any such right to\n  exercise such holder\'s dissenters\' rights with respect to such Company\n  Common Shares, each such share of such holder shall be treated as a share\n  that had been converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive\n  the Merger Consideration.\n     2.1.6 Fractional Shares. No fractional Microsoft Common Shares shall be\n  issued in the Merger and such fractional interests shall not entitle the\n  owner thereof to vote. In lieu of any fractional share, each holder of\n  Company Common Shares who would otherwise be entitled to receive a fraction\n  of a Microsoft Common Share will be entitled to receive from Company an\n  amount of cash, without interest, equal to the Microsoft Average Closing\n  Price multiplied by the fraction of a Microsoft Common Share to which such\n  holder would otherwise be entitled. The ""Microsoft Average Closing Price""\n  shall mean the average closing price of the Microsoft Common Stock as\n  publicly reported for the Nasdaq National Market System as of 4:00 p.m.\n  Eastern Time over the last 20 trading days ending on the fifth trading day\n  prior to the Closing Date.\n     2.1.7 Certain Restricted Shares. The Microsoft Common Shares issuable to\n  Douglas Burgum, Company\'s Chief Executive Officer, in exchange for his\n  Company Common Shares will be restricted from transfer as provided in a\n  Restricted Stock Agreement set forth as Exhibit 2.1.7 (the ""Restricted\n  Stock Agreement""), which shall be executed concurrently with the execution\n  of this Agreement.\n   2.2 Exchange of Certificates.\n     2.2.1 Exchange Agent. Prior to the Closing Date, Microsoft shall appoint\n  Mellon Investor Services L.L.C., or other bank or trust company reasonably\n  satisfactory to Company, to act as exchange agent (the ""Exchange Agent"") in\n  the Merger.\n     2.2.2 Microsoft to Provide Common Stock and Cash. Promptly after the\n  Effective Time, Microsoft shall make available to the Exchange Agent the\n  certificates representing whole Microsoft Common Shares issued pursuant to\n  Section 2.1 in exchange for outstanding Company Common Shares and, from\n  time to time, cash for payment in lieu of fractional shares.\n     2.2.3 Exchange Procedures. Microsoft shall use its reasonable best\n  efforts to cause the Exchange Agent, as soon as practicable but in any case\n  not more than fifteen (15) days after the Closing Date, to mail to each\n  holder of record as of the Effective Time, other than to those holders of\n  Dissenting Shares, of a Certificate or Certificates, (i) a letter of\n  transmittal (the ""Letter of Transmittal"") (which shall specify that\n  delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates\n  shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent)\n  and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the\n  Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a\n  Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with a duly\n  executed letter of transmittal and such other documents as the Exchange\n  Agent shall require, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to\n  receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration, as adjusted,\n  pursuant to Section 2.1 hereof plus cash in lieu of fractional shares as\n  provided in Section 2.1.6. The Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith\n  be canceled. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, until\n  holders of Certificates have surrendered them for exchange as provided\n  herein, (i) no dividends or other distributions shall be paid with respect\n  to any shares represented by such Certificates and no payment for\n  fractional shares shall be made, and (ii) without regard to when such\n  Certificates are surrendered for exchange as provided herein, no interest\n  shall be paid on any dividends or other distributions or any payment for\n  fractional shares. Upon surrender of a Certificate, there shall be paid to\n  the holder of such Certificate the amount of any dividends or other\n  distributions which theretofore became payable, but which were not paid by\n  reason of the foregoing, with respect to the number of whole Microsoft\n  Common Shares represented by the certificate or certificates issued upon\n  such surrender. If any certificate for Microsoft Common Shares is to be\n  issued in a name other than that in which the Certificate surrendered in\n  exchange therefore is registered, it shall be a condition of such exchange\n  that the person requesting such exchange pay any transfer or other taxes\n  required by reason of the issuance of certificates for such Microsoft\n  Common Shares in a name other than that of the registered holder of the\n  Certificate surrendered, or establish to the satisfaction of the Surviving\n                                      A-3\n<PAGE>\n  Corporation that such tax has been paid or is not applicable. In connection\n  with its undertakings pursuant to this Section 2.2.3, the Exchange Agent\n  shall be entitled to withhold any income taxes as required by the Code.\n     2.2.4 No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock. All Microsoft\n  Common Shares and cash delivered upon the surrender for exchange of Company\n  Common Shares in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have\n  been delivered in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such\n  Company Common Shares. After the Effective time there shall be no transfers\n  on the stock transfer books of Company of Company Common Shares. Upon the\n  effectiveness of the Merger, all Company Common Shares shall no longer be\n  outstanding and shall cease to exist, and each Certificate previously\n  representing any such shares shall represent only the right to receive the\n  form of Merger Consideration described in Section 2.1.3. If, after the\n  Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for\n  any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this\n  Article II. Certificates surrendered for exchange by any person\n  constituting an ""affiliate"" of Company for purposes of Rule 145(c) under\n  the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the ""Securities Act""), shall not be\n  exchanged until Microsoft receives a written agreement from such person as\n  provided by Section 6.6.\n     2.2.5 Return to Microsoft. Any Microsoft Common Shares and any cash made\n  available to the Exchange Agent and not exchanged for Certificates within\n  nine (9) months after the Effective Time and any dividends and\n  distributions held by the Exchange Agent for payment or delivery to the\n  holders of unsurrendered Certificates representing Company Common Stock and\n  unclaimed at the end of such nine month period shall be redelivered or\n  repaid by the Exchange Agent to Microsoft, after which time any holder of\n  Certificates who has not theretofore delivered or surrendered such\n  Certificates to the Exchange Agent, subject to applicable law, shall look\n  as a general creditor only to Microsoft for payment of the Microsoft Common\n  Shares, cash in lieu of fractional shares, and any such dividends or\n  distributions. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement, none of\n  Microsoft, the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Corporation or any other party\n  hereto shall be liable to any holder of Company Common Stock for any\n  Microsoft Common Shares, cash in lieu of fractional shares or dividends or\n  distributions delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable\n  abandoned property, escheat or similar law.\n   2.3 Company Options.\n     2.3.1 Conversion to Microsoft Options. At the Effective Time, each of\n  the then outstanding Company Options (as defined in Section 3.1.2) shall,\n  by virtue of the Merger and at the Effective Time, and without any further\n  action on the part of any holder thereof, be converted into an incentive\n  stock option or a nonstatutory option, depending on the type of Company\n  Option being converted, to purchase that number of Microsoft Common Shares\n  determined by multiplying the number of Company Common Shares subject to\n  such Company Option at the Effective Time by the Exchange Ratio, at an\n  exercise price per Microsoft Common Share equal to the exercise price per\n  share of such Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time\n  divided by the Exchange Ratio (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) (a\n  ""Substituted Microsoft Option""). If the foregoing calculation results in a\n  Substituted Microsoft Option being exercisable for a fraction of a\n  Microsoft Common Share, then the number of Microsoft Common Shares subject\n  to such option shall be rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares.\n  Continuous employment with Company shall be credited to the optionee for\n  purposes of determining the vesting of the number of Microsoft Common\n  Shares subject to exercise under the optionee\'s Substituted Microsoft\n  Option after the Effective Time. All vested options owned by a holder whose\n  employment or status as a nonemployee director with Company is terminated\n  on or before the Closing must be exercised within ninety (90) days of their\n  termination or such other period as may be provided for in the Company\n  Option and as set forth on Schedule 2.3.1.\n     2.3.2 Registration. Microsoft shall use its commercially reasonable best\n  efforts to cause the Microsoft Common Shares issuable upon exercise of the\n  Substituted Microsoft Options to be registered as of the Effective time on\n  a then effective Form S-8 promulgated by the SEC or to file a Form S-8\n  covering such options within ten (10) days of the Effective Time and shall\n  use its best efforts to maintain the\n                                      A-4\n<PAGE>\n  effectiveness of such registration statement or registration statements for\n  so long as such Substituted Microsoft Options remain outstanding. With\n  respect to those individuals who subsequent to the Merger will be subject\n  to the reporting requirements under Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act (as\n  defined in Section 3.1.3), Microsoft shall administer Company Options\n  assumed pursuant to this Section 2.3 in a manner that complies with Rule\n  16b-3 promulgated by the SEC under the Exchange Act, but shall have no\n  responsibility for such compliance by Company or its predecessors.\n  Microsoft shall use its commercially reasonable best efforts to give\n  holders of Substituted Microsoft Options notice of their new options as\n  soon as practicable after Effective time.\n     2.3.3 Incentive Stock Options. In the case of any Company Options to\n  which Section 421 of the Code applies by reason of Section 422 of the Code\n  (""Incentive Stock Options""), the option exercise price, the number of\n  Microsoft Common Shares purchasable pursuant to such option and the terms\n  and conditions of exercise of such option shall be determined in order to\n  comply with Section 424(a) of the Code. Microsoft will make good faith\n  efforts to ensure, to the extent permitted by the Code and to the extent\n  required by and subject to the terms of any such Incentive Stock Options,\n  that Company Options which qualified as Incentive Stock Options prior to\n  the Effective Time continue to qualify as Incentive Stock Options of\n  Microsoft after the Effective Time.\n                                  ARTICLE III\n                         REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES\n   3.1 Representations and Warranties of Company.

(the ""Company"") of the\nexchange ratio of 1.1 shares of Common Stock, par value $0.0000125 per share\n(the ""Microsoft Shares""), of Microsoft to be received for each Share (the\n""Exchange Ratio"") pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Reorganization, dated\nas of December 21, 2000 (the ""Agreement""), among Microsoft Corporation\n(""Microsoft""), Rubicon Acquisition Corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary of\nMicrosoft (""Merger Sub""), and the Company. Pursuant to the Agreement, Merger\nSub will be merged with and into the Company (the ""Merger"") and each\noutstanding Share will be converted into the right to receive a number of\nMicrosoft Shares equal to the Exchange Ratio.\nGoldman, Sachs & Co., as part of its investment banking business, is\ncontinually engaged in the valuation of businesses and their securities in\nconnection with mergers and acquisitions, negotiated underwritings, competitive\nbiddings, secondary distributions of listed and unlisted securities, private\nplacements and valuations for estate, corporate and other purposes. We are\nfamiliar with the Company having provided certain investment banking services\nto the Company from time to time, including having made an $8.3 million\nprincipal investment in the Company in 1994; having acted as a managing\nunderwriter of its initial public offering of 3,000,000 Shares in March 1997;\nhaving acted as a managing underwriter of public offerings of 588,000 Shares in\nApril 1998 and 2,000,000 Shares in March 1999; and having acted as its\nfinancial advisor in connection with, and having participated in certain of the\nnegotiations leading to, the Agreement. We also have provided certain\ninvestment banking services to Microsoft from time to time, including having\nacted as managing underwriter of a public offering of 10,954,616 shares of\nconvertible exchangeable preferred stock of Microsoft in December 1996; having\nacted as financial advisor to Microsoft in connection with its equity\ninvestment in Titus Communications Corporation in April 2000; having acted as a\nmanaging underwriter of the initial public offering of 5,200,000 shares and\nCommon Stock of Expedia, Inc., a subsidiary of Microsoft, in November 1999. We\nalso may provide investment banking services to Microsoft in the future.\nGoldman, Sachs & Co. provides a full range of financial advisory and securities\nservices and, in the course of its normal trading activities, may from time to\ntime effect transactions and hold positions in securities, including derivative\nsecurities, of the Company or Microsoft for its own account and for the\naccounts of customers.\nIn connection with this opinion, we have reviewed, among other things, the\nAgreement; the Registration Statement on Form S-1 of the Company, dated March\n5, 1997; Annual Reports to Stockholders and Annual Reports on Form 10-K of the\nCompany and Microsoft for the three fiscal years ended May 31, 2000 and for the\nfive fiscal years ended June 30, 2000, respectively; certain interim reports to\nstockholders and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q of the Company and Microsoft;\ncertain other communications from the Company and Microsoft to their respective\nstockholders; and certain internal financial analyses and forecasts for the\nCompany prepared by its management (the ""Company Forecasts""). We also have held\ndiscussions with members of the senior management of the Company and Microsoft\nregarding their assessment of the strategic rationale for, and\n                                      B-1\n<PAGE>\nthe potential benefits of, the transaction contemplated by the Agreement. We\nhave held discussions with members of senior management of the Company\nregarding their assessment of the past and current business operations,\nfinancial condition and future prospects of the Company. We have also held\ndiscussions with members of senior management of the Company and Microsoft\nregarding the past and current business operations, financial condition and\nfuture prospects of Microsoft. In addition, we have reviewed the reported price\nand trading activity for the Shares and the Microsoft Shares, compared certain\nfinancial and stock market information for the Company and Microsoft with\nsimilar information for certain other companies the securities of which are\npublicly traded, reviewed the financial terms of certain recent business\ncombinations in the software industry specifically and in other industries\ngenerally and performed such other studies and analyses as we considered\nappropriate.\nWe have relied upon the accuracy and completeness of all of the financial and\nother information discussed with or reviewed by us and have assumed such\naccuracy and completeness for purposes of rendering this opinion. In addition,\nwe have not made an independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets and\nliabilities of the Company or Microsoft or any of their subsidiaries and we\nhave not been furnished with any such evaluation or appraisal. With your\nconsent, we have taken into account the views of the Company\'s management of\nthe risks and uncertainties relating to the Company\'s ability to achieve the\nCompany Forecasts in the amounts and time periods contemplated thereby. As you\nare aware, Microsoft did not make available to us its projections of expected\nfuture performance. Accordingly, our review of such matters was limited to\ndiscussions with the management of Microsoft of certain research analysts\'\nestimates. With your consent, we have not conducted an independent evaluation\nof the pending litigation against Microsoft, including litigation regarding\nantitrust and intellectual property matters (the ""Litigation""), or the\nresulting liability or other consequences, if any, Microsoft may incur in\nconnection with the Litigation. Based on the information contained in\nMicrosoft\'s public filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and its\nrepresentations and warranties in the Agreement and after consulting with\ncounsel to the Company, you have directed us in rendering this opinion to\nassume that the Litigation will not have a material adverse effect on\nMicrosoft\'s financial condition or results of operations, the market price of\nMicrosoft Shares or, the conduct of the operations of Microsoft and its\nsubsidiaries. We were not requested to solicit, and did not solicit, interest\nfrom other parties with respect to an acquisition of or other business\ncombination with the Company (other than a limited discussion with one party\nwhich expressed an interest in the Company). Our advisory services and the\nopinion expressed herein are provided for the information and assistance of the\nBoard of Directors of the Company in connection with its consideration of the\ntransaction contemplated by the Agreement and such opinion does not constitute\na recommendation as to how any holder of Shares should vote with respect to\nsuch transaction.\nBased upon and subject to the foregoing and based upon such other matters as we\nconsider relevant, it is our opinion that as of the date hereof the Exchange\nRatio pursuant to the Agreement is fair from a financial point of view to the\nholders of Shares.\n                                          Very truly yours,\n                                          /s/ Goldman, Sachs & Co.\n                                          (Goldman, Sachs & Co.)\n                                      B-2\n<PAGE>\n                                                                         ANNEX C\n                     MINNESOTA DISSENTERS\' RIGHTS STATUTES\n                 Minnesota Statutes (S)(S) 302A.471 & 302A.473\n302A.471 Rights of dissenting shareholders.\n   Subdivision 1.

Payment; return of shares. (a) After the corporate action takes\neffect, or after the corporation receives a valid demand for payment, whichever\nis later, the corporation shall remit to each dissenting shareholder who has\ncomplied with subdivisions 3 and 4 the amount the corporation estimates to be\nthe fair value of the shares, plus interest, accompanied by:\n     (1) the corporation\'s closing balance sheet and statement of income for\n  a fiscal year ending not more than 16 months before the effective date of\n  the corporate action, together with the latest available interim financial\n  statements;\n     (2) an estimate by the corporation of the fair value of the shares and a\n  brief description of the method used to reach the estimate; and\n     (3) a copy of section 302A.471 and this section, and a brief description\n  of the procedure to be followed in demanding supplemental payment.\n   (b) The corporation may withhold the remittance described in paragraph (a)\nfrom a person who was not a shareholder on the date the action dissented from\nwas first announced to the public or who is dissenting on behalf of a person\nwho was not a beneficial owner on that date. If the dissenter has complied with\nsubdivisions 3 and 4, the corporation shall forward to the dissenter the\nmaterials described in paragraph (a), a statement of the reason for withholding\nthe remittance, and an offer to pay to the dissenter the amount listed in the\nmaterials if the dissenter agrees to accept that amount in full satisfaction.\nThe dissenter may decline the offer and demand payment under subdivision 6.\nFailure to do so entitles the dissenter only to the amount offered. If the\ndissenter makes demand, subdivisions 7 and 8 apply.\n   (c) If the corporation fails to remit payment within 60 days of the deposit\nof certificates or the imposition of transfer restrictions on uncertificated\nshares, it shall return all deposited certificates and cancel all transfer\nrestrictions. However, the corporation may again give notice under subdivision\n4 and require deposit or restrict transfer at a later time.\n   Subd. 6. Supplemental payment; demand. If a dissenter believes that the\namount remitted under subdivision 5 is less than the fair value of the shares\nplus interest, the dissenter may give written notice to the corporation of the\ndissenter\'s own estimate of the fair value of the shares, plus interest, within\n30 days after the corporation mails the remittance under subdivision 5, and\ndemand payment of the difference. Otherwise, a dissenter is entitled only to\nthe amount remitted by the corporation.\n   Subd. 7. Petition; determination. If the corporation receives a demand under\nsubdivision 6, it shall, within 60 days after receiving the demand, either pay\nto the dissenter the amount demanded or agreed to by the dissenter after\ndiscussion with the corporation or file in court a petition requesting that the\ncourt determine the fair value of the shares, plus interest. The petition shall\nbe filed in the county in which the registered office of the corporation is\nlocated, except that a surviving foreign corporation that receives a demand\nrelating to the shares of a constituent domestic corporation shall file the\npetition in the county in this state in which the last registered office of the\nconstituent corporation was located. The petition shall name as parties all\ndissenters who have demanded payment under subdivision 6 and who have not\nreached agreement with the corporation. The corporation shall, after filing the\npetition, serve all parties with a summons and copy of the petition under the\n                                      C-3\n<PAGE>\nrules of civil procedure. Nonresidents of this state may be served by\nregistered or certified mail or by publication as provided by law. Except as\notherwise provided, the rules of civil procedure apply to this proceeding. The\njurisdiction of the court is plenary and exclusive. The court may appoint\nappraisers, with powers and authorities the court deems proper, to receive\nevidence on and recommend the amount of the fair value of the shares. The court\nshall determine whether the shareholder or shareholders in question have fully\ncomplied with the requirements of this section, and shall determine the fair\nvalue of the shares, taking into account any and all factors the court finds\nrelevant, computed by any method or combination of methods that the court, in\nits discretion, sees fit to use, whether or not used by the corporation or by a\ndissenter. The fair value of the shares as determined by the court is binding\non all shareholders, wherever located. A dissenter is entitled to judgment in\ncash for the amount by which the fair value of the shares as determined by the\ncourt, plus interest, exceeds the amount, if any, remitted under subdivision 5,\nbut shall not be liable to the corporation for the amount, if any, by which the\namount, if any, remitted to the dissenter under subdivision 5 exceeds the fair\nvalue of the shares as determined by the court, plus interest.\n   Subd. 8. Costs; fees; expenses. (a) The court shall determine the costs and\nexpenses of a proceeding under subdivision 7, including the reasonable expenses\nand compensation of any appraisers appointed by the court, and shall assess\nthose costs and expenses against the corporation, except that the court may\nassess part or all of those costs and expenses against a dissenter whose action\nin demanding payment under subdivision 6 is found to be arbitrary, vexatious,\nor not in good faith.\n   (b) If the court finds that the corporation has failed to comply\nsubstantially with this section, the court may assess all fees and expenses of\nany experts or attorneys as the court deems equitable. These fees and expenses\nmay also be assessed against a person who has acted arbitrarily, vexatiously,\nor not in good faith in bringing the proceeding, and may be awarded to a party\ninjured by those actions.\n   (c) The court may award, in its discretion, fees and expenses to an attorney\nfor the dissenters out of the amount awarded to the dissenters, if any.\n                                      C-4\n<PAGE>\n                                    PART II\n                     INFORMATION NOT REQUIRED IN PROSPECTUS\nItem 20. Indemnification of Directors and Officers.\n   Article XII of the Restated Articles of Incorporation of the registrant\nauthorizes the registrant to indemnify any present or former director or\nofficer to the fullest extent not prohibited by the Washington Business\nCorporation Act, public policy or other applicable law. Sections 23B.8.510 and\n .570 of the Washington Business Corporation Act authorizes a corporation to\nindemnify its directors, officers, employees or agents in terms sufficiently\nbroad to permit such indemnification under certain circumstances for\nliabilities (including provisions permitting advances for expenses incurred)\narising under the Securities Act of 1933.\n   The registrant has agreed that if the merger is completed, all rights to\nindemnification (including advancement of expenses) of current or former\ndirectors, officers and employees of Great Plains and its subsidiaries arising\nfrom actions taken before the consummation of the merger, as provided in Great\nPlains\' articles of incorporation and bylaws and existing indemnification\nagreements, will be assumed by the registrant, will continue in full force and\neffect for six years from the effective date of the merger and will be\nguaranteed by the registrant.\n   In addition, the registrant maintains directors\' and officers\' liability\ninsurance under which the registrant\'s directors and officers are insured\nagainst loss (as defined in the policy) resulting from claims brought against\nthem for their wrongful acts in such capacities.\nItem 21. List of Exhibits.\n   The exhibits to this registration statement are listed in the Index to\nExhibits on page II-4.\nItem 22. Undertakings.\n   (a) The undersigned registrant hereby undertakes that, for purposes of\ndetermining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, each filing of the\nregistrant\'s annual report pursuant to Section 13(a) or Section 15(d) of the\nSecurities Exchange Act of 1934 (and, where applicable, each filing of an\nemployee benefit plan\'s annual report pursuant to Section 15(d) of the\nSecurities Exchange Act of 1934) that is incorporated by reference in the\nregistration statement shall be deemed to be a new registration statement\nrelating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities\nat that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof.\n   (b) (i) The undersigned registrant hereby undertakes as follows: that prior\nto any public reoffering of the securities registered hereunder through use of\na prospectus which is a part of this registration statement, by any person or\nparty who is deemed to be an underwriter within the meaning of Rule 145(c), the\nissuer undertakes that such reoffering prospectus will contain the information\ncalled for by the applicable registration form with respect to reofferings by\npersons who may be deemed underwriters, in addition to the information called\nfor by the other Items of the applicable form.\n   (ii) The registrant undertakes that every prospectus (a) that is filed\npursuant to paragraph (b)(i) immediately preceding, or (b) that purports to\nmeet the requirements of Section 10(a)(3) of the Securities Act and is used in\nconnection with an offering of securities subject to Rule 415, will be filed as\na part of an amendment to the registration statement and will not be used until\nsuch amendment is effective, and that, for purposes of determining any\nliability under the Securities Act of 1933, each such post-effective amendment\nshall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities\noffered therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be\ndeemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof.\n   (c) Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities\nAct of 1933 may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons of\nthe registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise,\n                                      II-1\n<PAGE>\nthe registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and\nExchange Commission such indemnification is against public policy as expressed\nin the Securities Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a\nclaim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by\nthe registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or\ncontrolling person of the registrant in the successful defense of any action,\nsuit or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person\nin connection with the securities being registered, the registrant will, unless\nin the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling\nprecedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether\nsuch indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the\nSecurities Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.\n   (d) The undersigned registrant hereby undertakes to respond to requests for\ninformation that is incorporated by reference into the prospectus pursuant to\nItems 4, 10(b), 11 or 13 of this Form, within one business day of receipt of\nsuch request, and to send the incorporated documents by first class mail or\nother equally prompt means. This includes information contained in documents\nfiled subsequent to the effective date of the registration statement through\nthe date of responding to the request.\n   (e) The undersigned registrant hereby undertakes to supply by means of a\npost-effective amendment all information concerning a transaction, and the\ncompany being acquired involved therein, that was not the subject of and\nincluded in the registration statement when it became effective.\n                  [Remainder of Page Intentionally Left Blank]\n                                      II-2\n<PAGE>\n                                   SIGNATURES\n   Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, the registrant\nhas duly caused this registration statement to be signed on its behalf by the\nundersigned, thereunto duly authorized, in the City of Redmond, State of\nWashington on February 1, 2001.\n                                          MICROSOFT CORPORATION\n                                                 /s/ Steven A.

These\n      products are a natural complement to the Microsoft Office business. For\n      Visio\'s shareholders, the merger offers the opportunity to receive a\n      significant premium over the market price that existed for shares of Visio\n      common stock before the public announcement of the merger. The merger also\n      offers Visio\'s shareholders the opportunity to continue to participate in\n      the growth of the business conducted by Microsoft and Visio following the\n      merger and to benefit from the potential appreciation in value of\n      Microsoft common stock.\nQ: What will I receive in the merger?\n   A: You will receive 0.45 of a share of Microsoft common stock for each share\n      of Visio common stock you own. For example, if you own 100 shares of\n      Visio common stock, you will receive 45 shares of Microsoft common stock.\n      Microsoft will not issue fractional shares of its common stock. Instead\n      of any fractional share, you will receive cash based on the average\n      market price of Microsoft common stock over a specified period of time\n      before the closing of the merger.\n      Stock options to purchase shares of Visio common stock will be assumed by\n      Microsoft and will automatically become options to purchase shares of\n      Microsoft common stock on the same terms and conditions as the assumed\n      Visio options. The number of shares subject to each option and the\n      exercise price per share will be adjusted to reflect the 0.45 exchange\n      ratio. Except for accelerated vesting of options granted to nonemployee\n      Visio directors, option vesting schedules will not be affected by the\n      merger.\nQ: What vote is required to approve the merger?\n   A: The holders of at least two-thirds of the outstanding shares of Visio\n      common stock must approve the merger agreement. Microsoft shareholders\n      are not required to approve the merger and will not vote on the merger.\n      You are entitled to cast one vote per share of Visio common stock you\n      owned at the close of business on October 21, 1999, the record date.\nQ: Does the board of directors of Visio recommend voting in favor of the merger\n   agreement?\n   A: Yes. After careful consideration, Visio\'s board of directors has\n      determined that the terms of the merger are fair to, and in the best\n      interests of, Visio and its shareholders and unanimously recommends that\n      you vote in favor of the merger agreement.\nQ: Are there risks I should consider in deciding whether to vote for the merger?\n   A: Yes. For example, Visio shareholders will receive 0.45 of a share of\n      Microsoft common stock for each share of Visio common stock they own,\n      regardless of the market price of either Microsoft common stock or Visio\n      common stock at the effective time of the merger. The market value of\n      Microsoft common stock is likely to fluctuate, and no one can accurately\n      predict what the market value will be either at the effective time of the\n      merger or after the merger. In evaluating the merger, you should\n      carefully consider this and other factors discussed in the section\n      entitled ""Risk Factors"" on page 12.\n                                       1\n<PAGE>\nQ: What do I need to do now?\n  A: You should cast your vote on the merger agreement by completing, signing\n     and dating your proxy card. You should return your completed proxy card\n     as soon as possible in the enclosed postage-paid envelope. If you return\n     your signed proxy card but do not include instructions on how to vote,\n     your shares will be voted ""FOR"" approval of the merger agreement. You can\n     also attend the special meeting and vote in person.\n     If you abstain from voting or do not vote, it will have the effect of\n     voting against approval of the merger agreement.\n     THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF VISIO UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT YOU VOTE\n     ""FOR"" APPROVAL OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT.\nQ: What do I do if I want to change my vote?\n  A: You can change your vote at any time before your proxy is voted at the\n     special meeting, in one of three ways. First, you can send ChaseMellon\n     Shareholder Services, L.L.C., the firm that Visio has retained to provide\n     proxy solicitation services, a written notice stating that you would like\n     to revoke your proxy. Second, you can complete and send a later-dated\n     signed proxy card to ChaseMellon. Third, you can attend the special\n     meeting and vote in person.\nQ: If my Visio shares are held in ""street name"" by my broker, will my broker\nvote my shares for me?\n  A: Your broker will vote your shares only if you provide instructions on how\n     to vote. You should fill out the voter instruction form sent to you by\n     your broker with this proxy statement/prospectus. If you do not give\n     instructions to your broker, your shares will not be voted, which will\n     have the effect of voting against the merger.\nQ: Should I send in my Visio stock certificates now?\n  A: No. After the merger is completed, we will send you written instructions\n     for exchanging your Visio stock certificates for Microsoft stock\n     certificates. Please do not send in your stock certificates with your\n     proxy card.\nQ: When do you expect the merger to be completed?\n  A: We are working toward completing the merger as quickly as possible. We\n     hope to complete the merger in late December 1999 or January 2000, if\n     regulatory approvals and other required matters are completed at that\n     time.\nQ: Will I recognize a taxable gain or loss on the transaction?\n  A: We expect that if the merger is completed, you will not recognize a gain\n     or loss for United States federal income tax purposes as a result of the\n     merger, except that you will recognize a gain or loss with respect to\n     cash received instead of a fractional share. However, we urge you to\n     consult your own tax advisor to determine the tax consequences particular\n     to your situation.\nQ: Whom should I call with questions?\n  A: If you have any questions about the merger or if you need additional\n     copies of the proxy statement/prospectus, you should contact:\n       Visio Investor Relations\n       2211 Elliott Avenue, Seattle, Washington 98121\n       (206) 956-6000\n     You may also obtain additional information about Microsoft and Visio from\n     documents we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, by\n     following the instructions in the section entitled ""Where you can find\n     more information"" on page 50.\n                                       2\n<PAGE>\n                   SUMMARY OF THIS PROXY STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS\n   This summary highlights selected information from this proxy\nstatement/prospectus and may not contain all of the information that is\nimportant to you.

The information on Visio\'s Web site is not part of this proxy\nstatement/prospectus.\n                                       4\n<PAGE>\n                           Summary of the Transaction\nThe merger (page 28)\n   In the merger, Visio and a wholly owned subsidiary of Microsoft will merge\nand Visio will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Microsoft.\n   The merger agreement, as amended, is attached to this proxy\nstatement/prospectus as Annex A. We encourage you to carefully read the merger\nagreement and the discussion of the merger and merger agreement in this proxy\nstatement/prospectus.\nVisio\'s reasons for the merger; recommendation of Visio\'s board of directors\n(pages 21, 22)\n   Visio\'s board of directors believes the merger will provide several benefits\nto Visio\'s shareholders, including:\n  . the opportunity for Visio\'s shareholders to receive a significant premium\n    over the market price for shares of Visio common stock existing before\n    the public announcement of the merger; and\n  . the ability of Visio\'s shareholders to continue to participate in the\n    growth of the business conducted by Microsoft and Visio following the\n    merger and to benefit from the potential appreciation in value of shares\n    of Microsoft common stock.\n   These potential benefits, however, may not be achieved. In addition, there\nare potential risks related to the merger, including:\n  . the risk that the merger may not be consummated and the effect of the\n    public announcement of the merger on Visio\'s sales and operating results\n    and Visio\'s ability to attract and retain key management, marketing,\n    technical, sales and other personnel; and\n  . the possibility that the market value of Microsoft common stock might\n    decrease, causing less aggregate value to be paid to Visio\'s\n    shareholders.\n   After careful consideration, Visio\'s board of directors approved the merger\nagreement and unanimously recommends that you vote ""FOR"" approval of the merger\nagreement.\nMerger consideration (page 28)\n   You will be entitled to receive 0.45 of a share of Microsoft common stock\nfor each share of Visio common stock you own. Instead of issuing fractional\nshares of stock, Microsoft will pay cash for fractional shares based on the\naverage market price of Microsoft common stock over a specified period of time\nbefore the closing of the merger.\nTreatment of options (page 29)\n   Outstanding options to purchase shares of Visio common stock will be assumed\nby Microsoft and will automatically become options to purchase shares of\nMicrosoft common stock on the same terms and conditions as the Visio options.\nThe number of shares subject to each option and the exercise price per share\nwill be adjusted to reflect the 0.45 exchange ratio. Except for accelerated\nvesting of options granted to nonemployee Visio directors, option vesting\nschedules will not be affected by the merger.\nTreatment of employee stock purchase and benefit plans (page 29)\n   Visio\'s 1995 Employee Stock Purchase Plan will be terminated the day before\nthe merger becomes effective. On that date, all funds that have been withheld\nfrom the wages of Visio employees for the purchase of Visio common stock under\nthe plan will be applied to a final purchase under the plan.\n                                       5\n<PAGE>\n   Immediately before the effective time of the merger, Visio will terminate or\nmodify according to Microsoft\'s direction all of Visio\'s employee benefit\nplans. Microsoft has agreed to offer Visio employees who remain at Microsoft\nbenefits commensurate with the benefits it gives to similarly situated\nMicrosoft employees.\nOpinion of Visio\'s financial advisor (page 22; Annex C)\n   In deciding to approve the merger, Visio\'s board of directors considered an\nopinion from its financial advisor, Morgan Stanley & Co., as to the fairness of\nthe exchange ratio from a financial point of view to holders of Visio common\nstock.\nVisio special meeting (page 16)\n   The special meeting of Visio\'s shareholders will be held on Monday, December\n13, 1999, at 10 a.m. local time, at Visio\'s headquarters, located at 2211\nElliott Avenue, Seattle, Washington. At the meeting, you will be asked to\napprove a merger agreement that will cause Visio to become a wholly owned\nsubsidiary of Microsoft. You can vote at the special meeting only if you owned\nshares of Visio common stock at the close of business on October 21, 1999, the\nrecord date.\nVotes required for approval (page 16)\n   The holders of at least two-thirds of the outstanding shares of Visio common\nstock must approve the merger agreement. Visio\'s shareholders are entitled to\ncast one vote for each share of Visio common stock they owned as of the record\ndate. Visio\'s directors and executive officers, who collectively held\napproximately 14% of Visio\'s outstanding common stock as of the record date,\nhave agreed to vote their shares in favor of the merger.\n   Microsoft\'s shareholders are not required to approve the merger and will not\nvote on the merger.\nConditions to completion of the merger (page 35)\n   Visio\'s and Microsoft\'s respective obligations to effect the merger are\nsubject to the prior satisfaction or waiver of specific conditions. The\nconditions that must be satisfied or waived before the completion of the merger\ninclude the following, subject to exceptions and qualifications:\n  . Visio\'s shareholders approve the merger agreement as required by\n    Washington law;\n  . no statute, regulation, order, decree or injunction prevents the merger;\n  . Visio and Microsoft receive all material consents and approvals for the\n    merger;\n  . Visio\'s and Microsoft\'s respective representations and warranties in the\n    agreement are true and correct except in respects that do not have a\n    material adverse effect;\n  . no material adverse change has occurred with respect to Visio\'s business\n    condition or the economic or business benefits expected from the merger;\n  . both Visio and Microsoft materially perform their obligations under the\n    merger agreement;\n  . both Visio and Microsoft receive required legal opinions, including\n    opinions that the merger will be treated for federal income tax purposes\n    as a tax-free reorganization; and\n  . Microsoft receives a letter from Ernst & Young LLP regarding that firm\'s\n    concurrence with the conclusion of Visio\'s management that Visio meets\n    the conditions necessary for it to enter into the business combination\n    accounted for as a pooling of interests.\n   If all of the conditions to closing are satisfied before December 30, 1999,\nMicrosoft may elect to postpone the closing to a date not later than December\n30, 1999. If Microsoft so elects, the obligations of the parties to effect the\nmerger will no longer be subject to any of the conditions to closing.\n                                       6\n<PAGE>\nNo other negotiations involving Visio (page 38)\n   Until the merger is completed or the merger agreement is terminated, Visio\nhas agreed, with limited exceptions, not to directly or indirectly take any of\nthe following actions with any party other than Microsoft:\n  . solicit, knowingly encourage, initiate or participate in any\n    negotiations, inquiries or discussions regarding any offer or proposal to\n    acquire all or any significant part of Visio\'s business, assets or\n    capital shares;\n  . enter into any agreement related to such an acquisition;\n  . make any public statement, recommendation or solicitation in support of\n    such an acquisition; or\n  . disclose any customarily nonpublic information about Visio in connection\n    with such an acquisition.\nHowever, Visio\'s board of directors may recommend to shareholders that they\ntender their shares in connection with a tender offer by an acquiror other than\nMicrosoft if the board determines in good faith that its fiduciary duty to its\nshareholders requires such a recommendation. In addition, the board can give\ninformation to a third party which has made an unsolicited acquisition proposal\nthat the board reasonably believes is financially more favorable to Visio and\nits shareholders than the merger with Microsoft.\n   Visio has agreed that it will inform Microsoft of the status and details of\nany unsolicited acquisition proposal or request for disclosure of or access to\nnonpublic information that it receives.\nTermination of the merger agreement (page 39)\n   Even if Visio\'s shareholders approve the merger agreement, Microsoft and\nVisio can agree at any time to terminate the merger agreement without\ncompleting the merger. In addition, subject to qualifications, the merger\nagreement may be terminated by either Visio or Microsoft under any of the\nfollowing circumstances:\n  . if the merger is not completed by March 31, 2000 (subject to extension to\n    September 30, 2000, if Microsoft and Visio have agreed to pursue\n    litigation against any administrative or judicial action or proceeding\n    challenging the merger on the basis that it violates antitrust law);\n  . if Visio\'s shareholders do not approve the merger agreement;\n  . if the other party materially breaches a representation, warranty,\n    covenant or agreement in the merger agreement and the breach has a\n    material adverse effect on the nonbreaching party and cannot reasonably\n    be cured; or\n  . if a final court order prohibiting the merger is issued and is not\n    appealable.\nIn addition, the merger agreement may also be terminated by Microsoft if:\n  . Visio\'s board modifies or withdraws its approval or recommendation of the\n    merger; or\n  . Visio or its representatives engage in the prohibited behavior, described\n    above, regarding potential acquisitions of Visio by parties other than\n    Microsoft and that action has a material adverse effect on Visio\'s\n    business condition.\nTermination fee (page 39)\n   Visio must pay Microsoft a termination fee of $30 million if Microsoft is\nnot then in material breach of the merger agreement and Microsoft terminates\nthe merger agreement for any of the following reasons:\n  . Visio or its representatives engage in the prohibited behavior, described\n    above, regarding potential acquisitions of Visio by parties other than\n    Microsoft;\n  . Visio\'s board of directors withdraws or modifies in a manner adverse to\n    Microsoft its approval or recommendation of the merger and Visio agrees\n    to an acquisition by a party other than Microsoft in a\n                                       7\n<PAGE>\n    transaction that will result in a change in the beneficial ownership of\n    more than 50% of the voting power of Visio\'s capital stock; or\n  . Visio willfully breaches a material provision of the merger agreement and\n    that breach has not been cured.\nThe stock option agreement (page 41; Annex B)\n   Visio has entered into a stock option agreement with Microsoft granting\nMicrosoft the option, under specific conditions, to buy up to 6,012,500 shares\nof Visio common stock, or 19.9% of Visio\'s issued and outstanding shares as of\nSeptember 14, 1999. The exercise price of the option is $42.78 per share.\n   The option becomes exercisable only if the merger agreement is terminated in\ncircumstances giving rise to payment of the termination fee described above.\nThe option will terminate on the earlier of the completion of the merger and\nthe termination of the merger agreement in circumstances under which the\ntermination fee is not payable.\n   The sum of Microsoft\'s total profit arising from the provisions of the\noption agreement and the termination fee provided for in the merger agreement\nmay not exceed $50 million.\nVisio management voting agreements (page 42)\n   As a condition to the merger, Microsoft required Visio\'s directors and\nexecutive officers, who collectively held approximately 14% of Visio\'s\noutstanding common stock as of October 21, 1999, the record date, to enter into\nvoting agreements with Microsoft. The voting agreements require Visio\'s\ndirectors and executive officers to vote all the shares of Visio common stock\nbeneficially owned by them in favor of the merger agreement. Visio\'s directors\nand executive officers also agreed not to sell or otherwise dispose of any\nshares of Visio common stock they own or acquire until the expiration of the\nvoting agreement, unless the sale would not, in Microsoft\'s reasonable\njudgment, violate the SEC\'s pooling-of-interests rules.\nInterests of Visio\'s directors and executive officers in the merger (page 29)\n   When considering the recommendation of Visio\'s board of directors, you\nshould be aware that some of Visio\'s directors and executive officers have\ninterests in the merger that are different from, or in addition to, yours.\nThese include indemnification rights, potential acceleration of option vesting\nand other benefits and payments under certain agreements and employee benefit\nand retention plans. Visio\'s board of directors was aware of and considered the\ninterests of Visio\'s directors and executive officers in approving the merger\nagreement and recommending that Visio\'s shareholders approve the merger\nagreement.\nRestrictions on the ability to sell Microsoft stock (page 31)\n   All shares of Microsoft common stock received by you in connection with the\nmerger will be freely transferable unless you are considered an affiliate of\neither Visio or Microsoft under the Securities Act of 1933. Shares of Microsoft\ncommon stock held by affiliates may be sold only under a registration statement\nor an exemption from registration under the Securities Act.\n   Microsoft has received letter agreements from each of Visio\'s executive\nofficers and directors, each of whom may be considered an affiliate of Visio.\nEach of these persons has agreed that he or she will not sell, transfer or\notherwise dispose of, except by gift, more than a de minimus amount of shares\nof Visio or Microsoft common stock during the 30 days before the merger and,\nafter the merger, until the date that Microsoft files with the SEC or publishes\nfinancial statements that reflect at least 30 days of combined operations. In\nreturn, Microsoft has agreed to publish financial statements covering at least\n30 days of combined operations as soon as practicable after the end of a\ncalendar month that is at least 30 days after the effective time of the merger.\n                                       8\n<PAGE>\nTax consequences of the merger (page 31)\n   Microsoft and Visio intend the merger to qualify as a tax-free\nreorganization under the Internal Revenue Code. It is a condition to the\ncompletion of the merger that both parties receive an opinion from their tax\ncounsel that the merger will so qualify. We expect that none of Visio,\nMicrosoft or their respective shareholders will recognize a gain or loss for\nUnited States federal income tax purposes, except for taxes payable for cash\nreceived instead of fractional shares of Microsoft common stock. Because tax\nmatters are complicated, however, we urge you to consult your own tax advisor\nto understand fully how the merger will affect you, including how any state,\nlocal or foreign tax laws may apply to you.\nAccounting treatment of the merger (page 33)\n   Microsoft expects to account for the merger using the pooling-of-interests\nmethod of accounting under generally accepted accounting principles. Microsoft\nhas reserved the right, however, to cause the merger to be accounted for as a\npurchase.\nRegulatory approvals required to complete the merger (page 33)\n   The merger is subject to antitrust laws, including the reporting and waiting\nperiod provisions of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act. Microsoft and Visio have made\nthe required premerger notification filings with the Federal Trade Commission\nand the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice. On October 29, 1999,\npursuant to the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act, the Antitrust Division issued requests\nfor additional information and documents to both Microsoft and Visio. The\nrequests extended the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act for a\nperiod ending 20 days after both parties have filed a proper response.\n   Due to the international scope of Microsoft\'s and Visio\'s businesses,\nregulatory filings will also be required in certain European and other\njurisdictions. Microsoft and Visio do not expect those filings to affect the\nexpected timing of the merger.\nDissenters\' rights (page 44; Annex D)\n   Under Washington law, Visio\'s shareholders have the right to dissent from\nthe merger and to receive payment in cash for the fair value of their shares of\nVisio common stock. To preserve their rights, Visio\'s shareholders who wish to\nexercise their statutory dissenters\' rights must precisely follow the\nprocedures described in chapter 23B.13 of the Washington Business Corporation\nAct, a copy of which is attached as Annex D.\nDifferences in rights of Visio and Microsoft shareholders (page 43)\n   The rights of Visio\'s shareholders are governed by Washington law and\nVisio\'s articles of incorporation and bylaws. When the merger is completed,\nVisio\'s shareholders will become shareholders of Microsoft. Because Microsoft,\nlike Visio, is a Washington corporation, the rights of Visio\'s shareholders\nwill continue to be governed by Washington law. However, the rights of Visio\'s\nshareholders will also be governed by Microsoft\'s articles of incorporation and\nbylaws, which differ in some respects from Visio\'s.\nComparative market price information (page 14)\n   Shares of both Microsoft common stock and Visio common stock are listed on\nthe Nasdaq Stock Market. On September 14, 1999, the last full trading day\nbefore the public announcement of the proposed merger, Microsoft\'s common stock\nclosed at $95.06 per share and Visio\'s common stock closed at $33.50 per share.\nOn October 29, 1999, the last full trading day for which closing prices were\navailable at the time of the printing of this proxy statement/prospectus,\nMicrosoft\'s common stock closed at $92.56 per share and Visio\'s common stock\nclosed at $39.59 per share. We urge you to obtain current market quotations.\n                                       9\n<PAGE>\n                 Selected financial data of Microsoft and Visio\n   The following tables provide selected financial data of Microsoft and Visio,\nwhich were derived from the audited financial statements of Microsoft and Visio\nfor the last five years for which audited financial statements have been\nprepared. The data should be read in conjunction with the financial statements,\nrelated notes and other financial information of Microsoft and Visio that are\nincorporated by reference into this proxy statement/prospectus. The Visio table\nalso provides selected financial data of Visio as of June 30, 1999 and for the\nnine months ended June 30, 1999 and 1998, which were derived from unaudited\nfinancial statements of Visio. In Visio\'s opinion, the unaudited financial\nstatements include all adjustments necessary for the fair presentation of\nVisio\'s financial position and results of operations for those periods. The\nhistorical results for the nine-month periods may not be indicative of the\nresults of operations for a full year.\n                      Selected financial data of Microsoft\n<TABLE>\n<CAPTION>\n                                               Fiscal Year Ended June 30,\n                                         --------------------------------------\n                                          1995   1996    1997    1998    1999\n                                         ------ ------- ------- ------- -------\n                                           (in millions, except earnings per\n                                                         share)\n<S>                                      <C>    <C>     <C>     <C>     <C>\nIncome Statement Data:\nRevenue................................  $6,075 $ 9,050 $11,936 $15,262 $19,747\nNet income.............................   1,453   2,195   3,454   4,490   7,785\nBasic earnings per share...............    0.31    0.46    0.72    0.92    1.54\nDiluted earnings per share.............    0.29    0.43    0.66    0.84    1.42\n<CAPTION>\n                                                        June 30,\n                                         --------------------------------------\n                                          1995   1996    1997    1998    1999\n                                         ------ ------- ------- ------- -------\n                                          (in millions, except book value per\n                                                         share)\n<S>                                      <C>    <C>     <C>     <C>     <C>\nBalance Sheet Data:\nCash and short-term investments........  $4,750 $ 6,940 $ 8,966 $13,927 $17,236\nTotal assets...........................   7,210  10,093  14,387  22,357  37,156\nStockholders\' equity...................   5,333   6,908  10,777  16,627  28,438\nHistorical book value per share(1).....                                 $  5.57\nShares used in computing book value per\n share(2)..............................                                   5,109\n</TABLE>\n                                       10\n<PAGE>\n                        Selected financial data of Visio\n<TABLE>\n<CAPTION>\n                                                                    Nine Months Ended\n                              Fiscal Year Ended September 30,           June 30,\n                         ------------------------------------------ -----------------\n                          1994     1995    1996     1997     1998   1998(2)  1999(2)\n                         -------  ------- ------- -------- -------- -------- --------\n                                    (in thousands, except per share data)\n<S>                      <C>      <C>     <C>     <C>      <C>      <C>      <C>\nIncome Statement Data:\nRevenue................. $20,616  $34,224 $59,862 $100,775 $165,995 $121,772 $149,888\nOperating income........     157    2,932  13,570   14,836   32,786   21,903   37,646\nNet income (loss).......

The\nmarket value of Microsoft common stock is likely to change, both before and\nafter the merger, and no one can accurately predict what the market value will\nbe at any given time. Market prices of Microsoft and Visio common stock may\nvary for many reasons, including changes in the business, operations or\nprospects of Microsoft or Visio, market assessments of the likelihood that the\nmerger will be completed, the timing of regulatory considerations and general\nmarket and economic conditions. Because the merger will be completed after the\nspecial meeting, the prices of Microsoft and Visio common stock on the date of\nthe special meeting may not be indicative of their prices on the date the\nmerger is completed. Visio cannot ""walk away"" from the merger or resolicit the\nvote of its shareholders based solely on changes in the value of Microsoft\ncommon stock. We urge you to obtain current market quotations for Microsoft and\nVisio common stock.\nVisio\'s directors and executive officers have conflicts of interest that may\ninfluence them to support the merger.\n   The directors and executive officers of Visio participate in arrangements\nthat provide them with interests in the merger that are different from, or are\nin addition to, yours. These interests include indemnification rights,\npotential acceleration of option vesting and other benefits under certain\nagreements and employee benefit plans. In addition, some of Visio\'s executive\nofficers may receive payments and other benefits under a retention and\ntransition bonus plan that Microsoft implemented under the merger agreement. As\na result, Visio\'s directors and executive officers could be more likely to vote\nto approve the merger agreement than if they did not hold these interests. You\nshould consider whether these interests may have influenced these directors and\nexecutive officers to support and recommend the merger.\nFailure to complete the merger could negatively impact Visio\'s stock price and\nfuture business and operations.\n   If the merger is not completed for any reason, Visio may be subject to a\nnumber of material risks, including the following:\n  . Visio may be required to pay Microsoft a termination fee of $30 million;\n  . the stock option granted to Microsoft by Visio may become exercisable;\n  . the price of Visio common stock may decline to the extent that the\n    current market price of Visio common stock reflects an assumption that\n    the merger will be completed; and\n  . Visio must pay its costs related to the merger, such as legal, accounting\n    and financial advisory fees and employee retention bonuses, even if the\n    merger is not completed.\n   In addition, Visio\'s customers may, in response to the announcement of the\nmerger, delay or defer purchasing decisions. Any delay or deferral in\npurchasing decisions by Visio customers could have a material adverse effect on\nVisio\'s business, regardless of whether or not the merger is ultimately\ncompleted. Similarly, current and prospective Visio employees may experience\nuncertainty about their future role with Microsoft until Microsft\'s strategies\nwith regard to Visio are announced or executed. This may adversely affect\nVisio\'s ability to attract and retain key management, marketing, technical,\nsales and other personnel.\n                                       12\n<PAGE>\n   Further, if the merger is terminated and Visio\'s board of directors\ndetermines to seek another merger or business combination, it may not be able\nto find a partner willing to pay an equivalent or more attractive price than\nthat which would have been paid in the merger. In addition, while the merger\nagreement is in effect, subject to limited exceptions described on page 38 of\nthis proxy statement/prospectus, Visio is prohibited from soliciting,\ninitiating, participating in any negotiations regarding, or entering into\nspecified extraordinary transactions, such as a merger, sale of assets or other\nbusiness combination with any party other than Microsoft. Furthermore, if the\nmerger agreement is terminated and Microsoft\'s option to purchase Visio common\nstock becomes exercisable, Visio would not be able to account for the\ntransaction that triggered the exercisability of the option as a pooling of\ninterests.\nThe price of Microsoft common stock may be affected by factors different from\nthose affecting the price of Visio common stock.\n   Upon completion of the merger, the holders of Visio common stock will become\nholders of Microsoft common stock. Microsoft\'s business differs from that of\nVisio, and Microsoft\'s results of operations and the price of Microsoft common\nstock may be affected by factors different from those that affected Visio\'s\nresults of operations and the price of Visio common stock before the merger.\nFor a discussion of Microsoft\'s and Visio\'s businesses and factors to consider\nin connection with those businesses, see Microsoft\'s Annual Report on Form 10-K\nfor the fiscal year ended June 30, 1999, other documents Microsoft has\nsubsequently filed with the SEC, Visio\'s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the\nfiscal year ended September 30, 1998 and other documents Visio has subsequently\nfiled with the SEC, which are incorporated by reference into this proxy\nstatement/prospectus.\n                                       13\n<PAGE>\n                COMPARATIVE STOCK PRICE AND DIVIDEND INFORMATION\n   Visio common stock has been traded on the Nasdaq Stock Market under the\nsymbol VSIO since November 10, 1995, the date of Visio\'s initial public\noffering. Microsoft common stock has been traded on the Nasdaq Stock Market\nunder the symbol MSFT since March 13, 1986, the date of Microsoft\'s initial\npublic offering.\n   The following table lists, for the calendar quarters indicated, the high and\nlow sales prices per share of Visio common stock and Microsoft common stock as\nreported on the Nasdaq Stock Market.

The table also\nlists the equivalent per share price of Visio common stock on those dates. The\nequivalent per share price is equal to the closing price of a share of\nMicrosoft common stock on that date multiplied by 0.45, the number of shares of\nMicrosoft common stock to be issued in connection with the merger in exchange\nfor each share of Visio common stock.\n<TABLE>\n<CAPTION>\n                                                     Microsoft Visio  Equivalent\n                                                      Common   Common Per Share\n                                                       Stock   Stock    Price\n                                                     --------- ------ ----------\n   <S>                                               <C>       <C>    <C>\n   September 14, 1999...............................  $95.06   $33.50   $42.78\n   October 29, 1999.................................   92.56    39.59    41.65\n</TABLE>\n   We believe that Visio common stock presently trades on the basis of the\nvalue of the Microsoft common stock expected to be issued in exchange for Visio\ncommon stock in the merger, discounted primarily for the uncertainties\nassociated with the merger. Microsoft cannot state with certainty what factors\naccount for changes in the market price of Microsoft common stock.\n   We advise you to obtain current market quotations for Microsoft common stock\nand Visio common stock. The market prices of Microsoft common stock and Visio\ncommon stock at any time before the merger, and the market price of Microsoft\ncommon stock at any time after the merger, may fluctuate. The exchange ratio\nwill\n                                       14\n<PAGE>\nnot be adjusted for any increases or decreases in the market price of Microsoft\ncommon stock that occur before the merger becomes effective. If the market\nprice of Microsoft common stock decreases or increases before the merger, the\nvalue of the Microsoft common stock to be received in the merger in exchange\nfor Visio common stock will correspondingly decrease or increase.\n   Neither Visio nor Microsoft has ever paid cash dividends on its shares of\ncommon stock. Visio has agreed not to pay cash dividends before the merger\nwithout Microsoft\'s written consent. If the merger is not completed, Visio\npresently intends that it would continue to retain all earnings to finance the\nexpansion of its business. Similarly, Microsoft has no present intention to pay\ncash dividends on its common stock before or after the merger.\n                                       15\n<PAGE>\n                           THE VISIO SPECIAL MEETING\nDate, time, place and purpose of Visio\'s special meeting\n   The special meeting of Visio\'s shareholders will be held at 10 a.m. local\ntime on December 13, 1999, at Visio\'s headquarters, located at 2211 Elliott\nAvenue, Seattle, Washington. At the meeting, Visio\'s shareholders as of the\nrecord date will be asked to approve the merger agreement with Microsoft.\nRecord date; outstanding shares; shares entitled to vote\n   Only holders of record of Visio common stock at the close of business on\nthe record date, October 21, 1999, are entitled to notice of and to vote at\nthe special meeting. As of the record date, there were 30,431,714 shares of\nVisio common stock outstanding, held of record by approximately 18,000\nshareholders. Each holder of Visio common stock is entitled to one vote for\neach share of Visio common stock he or she owned as of the record date. If you\ndo not vote, either in person or by proxy, it will have the same effect as\nvoting against the merger agreement.\nQuorum; vote required\n   The required quorum for the transaction of business at the special meeting\nis a majority of the shares of Visio common stock outstanding on the record\ndate, represented in person or by proxy.\n   The affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of the\noutstanding shares of Visio common stock is required to approve the merger\nagreement.\nVoting of proxies\n   The Visio board of directors requests that you return the proxy card\naccompanying this proxy statement/prospectus for use at the meeting. Please\ncomplete, date and sign the proxy card and promptly return it to ChaseMellon\nShareholder Services, L.L.C., the firm that Visio has retained to provide\nproxy solicitation services, in the enclosed envelope. All properly signed\nproxies received by ChaseMellon and not revoked before the vote at the meeting\nwill be voted at the meeting according to the instructions indicated on the\nproxies or, if no instructions are given, to approve the merger agreement.\n   We do not expect that any matter other than approval of the merger\nagreement will be brought before the special meeting. If other matters are\nproperly presented and are within the purpose of the special meeting, however,\nthe persons named as proxies will vote in accordance with their judgment with\nrespect to those matters.\n   If you have questions or need assistance in completing or submitting your\nproxy card, please contact ChaseMellon at the following address and telephone\nnumber:\n   ChaseMellon Shareholder Services, L.L.C.\n   520 Pike Street, Suite 1220\n   Seattle, Washington 98101\n   (800) 610-3775\nRecommendation of Visio\'s board of directors\n   VISIO\'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT YOU VOTE ""FOR""\nAPPROVAL OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT.\nShare ownership of management\n   As of the record date, Visio\'s directors and executive officers\ncollectively owned 4,206,137 shares of Visio\n                                      16\n<PAGE>\ncommon stock, or approximately 14% of Visio\'s outstanding shares. All of\nVisio\'s executive officers and directors have executed voting agreements with\nMicrosoft, under which they have agreed to vote their shares in favor of the\nmerger.\nHow to revoke your proxy\n   You may revoke your proxy at any time by taking any of the following actions\nbefore your proxy is voted at the meeting:\n  . delivering to ChaseMellon a written notice bearing a date later than the\n    date of the proxy card, stating that you revoke the proxy;\n  . signing and delivering to ChaseMellon a proxy card relating to the same\n    shares and bearing a later date; or\n  . attending the meeting and voting in person, although attendance at the\n    meeting will not, by itself, revoke a proxy.\n   Please note, however, that if your shares are held of record by a broker,\nbank or other nominee and you wish to vote at the meeting, you must bring to\nthe meeting a letter from the broker, bank or other nominee confirming your\nbeneficial ownership of the shares.\nAbstentions and broker nonvotes\n   Only shares affirmatively voted for approval of the merger agreement,\nincluding shares represented by properly executed proxies that do not contain\nvoting instructions, will be counted as votes ""for"" the merger agreement.\n   Brokers who hold shares of Visio common stock in street name for a customer\nwho is the beneficial owner of those shares may not give a proxy to vote the\ncustomer\'s shares without specific instructions from the customer. These\nnonvoted shares are referred to as broker nonvotes. If your broker holds your\nVisio stock in street name, your broker will vote your shares only if you\nprovide instructions on how to vote by filling out the voter instruction form\nsent to you by your broker with this proxy statement/prospectus.\n   Abstentions and broker nonvotes will be included in determining the presence\nof a quorum, but will have the same effect as voting against the merger\nagreement.\nVoting electronically via Internet or telephone\n   A large number of banks and brokerage firms are participating in the ADP\nInvestor Communication Services online program. This program provides\nshareholders whose shares are registered in the name of a participating bank or\nbrokerage firm the opportunity to vote via the Internet or by telephone. The\nvoting form sent to a beneficial owner will provide instructions if such\noptions are available.\nExpenses of proxy solicitation\n   The enclosed proxy is solicited by and on behalf of Visio\'s board of\ndirectors. Visio will pay the expenses of soliciting proxies to be voted at the\nmeeting. Following the original mailing of the proxies and other soliciting\nmaterials, Visio and its agents also may solicit proxies by mail, telephone,\nfacsimile or in person. Visio has retained a proxy solicitation firm,\nChaseMellon Shareholder Services, L.L.C., to aid it in the solicitation\nprocess. Visio will pay that firm a fee of $7,500, plus an additional amount\nfor each shareholder contacted by ChaseMellon, plus reasonable expenses. Visio\nintends to reimburse persons who hold Visio stock of record but not\nbeneficially, such as brokers, custodians, nominees and fiduciaries, for their\nreasonable expenses in forwarding copies of proxies and other soliciting\nmaterials to, and requesting authority for the exercise of proxies from, the\npersons for whom they hold the shares.\n                                       17\n<PAGE>\nDissenters\' rights\n   Under Washington law, you have the right to dissent from the merger and to\nreceive payment in cash for the fair value of your shares of Visio common\nstock. To preserve your rights if you wish to exercise your statutory\ndissenters\' rights, you must:\n  . deliver to the secretary of Visio before the special meeting written\n    notice of your intent to demand payment for your shares of Visio common\n    stock if the merger is completed;\n  . not vote your shares in favor of the merger agreement; and\n  . follow the statutory procedures for perfecting dissenters\' rights under\n    Washington law, which are described in the section entitled ""Rights of\n    dissenting Visio shareholders"" on page 44.\n   Merely voting against the merger agreement will not preserve your\ndissenters\' rights. Chapter 23B.13 of the Washington Business Corporation Act\nis reprinted in its entirety and attached to this proxy statement/prospectus as\nAnnex D. Failure to precisely comply with all procedures required by Washington\nlaw will result in the loss of your dissenters\' rights.\nAccountants\n   Representatives of Ernst & Young LLP, Visio\'s accountants, are expected to\nbe present at the special meeting, will have the opportunity to make a\nstatement and will be available to respond to appropriate questions.\n You should not send in any certificates representing Visio common stock.\n Following the effective time of the merger, you will receive instructions\n for the surrender and exchange of your Visio stock certificates.\n                                       18\n<PAGE>\n                                  THE MERGER\n   This section of the proxy statement/prospectus describes the proposed\nmerger. While we believe that this description covers the material terms of\nthe merger, this summary may not contain all of the information that is\nimportant to you. You should carefully read this entire proxy\nstatement/prospectus and the other documents to which we refer for a more\ncomplete understanding of the merger.\nBackground of the merger\n   Visio and Microsoft have enjoyed a close working relationship since Visio\'s\ninitial product launch. Visio has historically been a developer of products\nbased on Microsoft platforms. For example, the Visio graphics engine employs\nMicrosoft Windows(R) technology, and Visio has worked extensively with\nMicrosoft to more fully utilize the capabilities of Windows technology.\nVisio\'s products are very compatible with several Microsoft applications, with\nsimilar user interfaces, similar help systems and built-in Microsoft\ndevelopment tools. Visio and Microsoft have also developed joint marketing\ninitiatives from time to time and have purchased and sold products to each\nother.\n   In late 1998, Jeremy Jaech, the chief executive officer of Visio, met with\nMicrosoft representatives to discuss the possibility of the two companies\npartnering in some manner to further expand their existing relationship.\n   During regularly scheduled meetings in late 1998 and early 1999, the\nmembers of Visio\'s board of directors discussed the strategic opportunities\nand challenges arising in connection with Visio\'s business. At meetings in\nJanuary and April 1999, Visio\'s board noted the possible synergistic benefits\nof a broader relationship with Microsoft and agreed that Mr. Jaech should\nexplore, on a preliminary basis, such a relationship with senior management of\nMicrosoft.\n   In early February 1999, Mr. Jaech began discussions with Robert McDowell, a\nMicrosoft officer, regarding Mr. McDowell joining Visio\'s board. Mr. McDowell\nwas elected to Visio\'s board on April 23, 1999.\n   In early May 1999, Mr. Jaech met with Steven Ballmer, the president of\nMicrosoft, to begin the process of determining whether a closer relationship,\nincluding a business combination, would be desirable. Messrs. Jaech and\nBallmer agreed to continue to explore, on a preliminary basis, such a\nrelationship.\n   Robert Muglia, the senior vice president of Microsoft\'s Business\nProductivity group, Mr. Jaech and other Microsoft and Visio representatives\nmet in late May 1999 to discuss generally Visio\'s business and its products.\n   Visio\'s board met at a regularly scheduled meeting on May 27-28 to discuss\nprincipally international strategic issues. At that meeting, the board\nreceived a report concerning the preliminary discussions held with Microsoft.\nAfter its consideration of the report, the board advised Visio\'s executive\nmanagement team that it should continue exploratory discussions. Because Mr.\nMcDowell is a member of Visio\'s board and a Microsoft executive, Mr. McDowell\nexcused himself from all deliberations by Visio\'s board regarding a possible\nbusiness combination with Microsoft.\n   On June 9, 1999, Visio and Microsoft entered into a nondisclosure agreement\ncontaining customary terms.\n   During the early and mid-part of June 1999, Visio provided Microsoft\nlimited product, financial and geographic information concerning Visio\'s\nbusiness. In the second week of July 1999, Messrs. Muglia and Jaech and other\nrepresentatives of Visio and Microsoft met to discuss Visio\'s products and\nsales strategies. At the meeting, the Visio representatives demonstrated\nVisio\'s products to the Microsoft representatives. Following the meeting,\nVisio provided Microsoft with additional requested information regarding its\nproducts and business.\n                                      19\n<PAGE>\n   On July 28, 1999, representatives of Visio and Microsoft met again to\nfurther review Visio\'s products and its sales strategies, particularly with\nrespect to corporate customers. In addition, Visio retained legal counsel\nduring the last week of July 1999 and retained a financial advisor, Morgan\nStanley & Co., during the second week of August 1999 to assist Visio in its\ndiscussions with Microsoft.\n   On July 30, 1999, Messrs. Muglia and Jaech discussed their respective\ncompany\'s mutual desire to explore a possible business combination on a\npreliminary basis. They further discussed how to proceed with due diligence\nreviews of each company. During early August, Microsoft continued its due\ndiligence review of Visio. On August 9, 1999, Visio and Microsoft entered into\nan amended nondisclosure agreement.\n   At a meeting of Microsoft\'s board of directors on August 8, 1999,\nMicrosoft\'s management made a presentation to Microsoft\'s board regarding the\npotential for an acquisition of Visio. After the presentation, which included\nMicrosoft\'s reasons for entering into the merger discussed on page 28 of this\nproxy statement/prospectus, Microsoft\'s board approved the transaction and\ndelegated to Microsoft\'s management the responsibility to negotiate and execute\na definitive merger agreement and related documents.\n   Visio\'s board met telephonically on August 11, 1999. At that meeting, Mr.\nJaech reported on the status of the discussions with Microsoft, and Visio\'s\nsenior management team, together with legal and financial advisors, discussed\nwith the board various legal, commercial, employee and financial\nconsiderations. The board advised the management team to continue to explore\nthe possible terms and conditions of a business combination transaction.\nThroughout the remainder of August, Mr. Jaech regularly communicated with\nmembers of Visio\'s board to update the members regarding the status of the\npreliminary discussions with Microsoft.\n   In late August, representatives of Visio and Microsoft held preliminary\ndiscussions regarding a range of possible values to be paid on a per share\nbasis to the shareholders of Visio. The representatives also discussed various\nother financial, tax and accounting issues during this period. On August 23,\n1999, with due diligence continuing, Microsoft\'s legal counsel forwarded a\ndraft merger agreement to Visio and its legal and financial advisors.\n   Beginning on September 8, 1999, Visio and Microsoft representatives and\nlegal counsel held numerous discussions regarding the terms and conditions of\nthe proposed merger agreement and various other legal, financial, accounting\nand regulatory issues, including, among other things, closing conditions, the\nidentification of required regulatory filings and the treatment of Visio\nemployee benefit plans.\n   On September 12, 1999, Visio\'s board met to review the terms of the proposed\nmerger. Representatives of Morgan Stanley made a presentation regarding the\nfinancial terms of the proposed merger and discussed with Visio\'s board, among\nother things, the financial performance of Visio and Microsoft. Visio\'s outside\nlegal counsel also reviewed certain legal matters with Visio\'s board, including\na detailed review of the proposed merger agreement, the board\'s fiduciary\nduties in the context of the proposed transaction and other relevant aspects of\napplicable law. Following these presentations and discussions, Visio\'s board\nauthorized senior management to continue to pursue the proposed merger.\n   From September 12-14, 1999, the management teams of Visio and Microsoft,\ntogether with their legal advisors, continued to discuss various issues,\nincluding those relating to employee benefits, the rights of either party to\nterminate the merger agreement and whether any payment would be due as a result\nof a termination of the merger agreement under certain circumstances.\n   Visio\'s board met again on September 14, 1999 to continue its discussions\nregarding the merger and to further review the terms and conditions of the\nproposed merger with senior management, outside legal counsel and Morgan\nStanley. During this meeting, Visio\'s board received the oral opinion of Morgan\nStanley, later confirmed in writing, that, as of that date, the exchange ratio\nset forth in the merger agreement was fair from a financial point of view to\nholders of Visio common stock. Following further discussions, Visio\'s board\ndetermined that the merger is fair to, and in the best interests of, Visio and\nits shareholders, approved the merger and the merger agreement and related\nagreements, and resolved to recommend that the shareholders of Visio vote to\napprove the merger agreement.\n                                       20\n<PAGE>\n   The merger agreement and related documents were signed by Visio and\nMicrosoft late in the evening on September 14, 1999. On the morning of\nSeptember 15, 1999, before trading commenced on Nasdaq, the companies issued a\njoint press release announcing the execution of the merger agreement.\n   On October 29, 1999, the parties amended provisions of the merger agreement\nrelating to the closing date, accountants\' comfort letters, certain employee\nbenefits matters and the publication of post-closing financial results.\nVisio\'s reasons for the merger\n   In reaching its decision to approve and adopt the merger agreement and to\nunanimously recommend that Visio shareholders approve the merger agreement,\nVisio\'s board identified reasons why the merger should be beneficial to Visio\nand its shareholders. These potential benefits include the following:\n  . the opportunity for Visio shareholders to receive a significant premium\n    over the market price for shares of Visio common stock existing before\n    the public announcement of the merger. Specifically, the exchange ratio\n    in the merger represented a 27.7% premium over the closing price for\n    Visio common stock on September 14, 1999, the day that Visio and\n    Microsoft reached final agreement on the merger agreement, as well as\n    39.4%, 29.4% and 27.4% premiums over the average closing price of Visio\n    common stock for the 10, 30 and 60 trading days, respectively, ending on\n    September 10, 1999;\n  . the ability of Visio shareholders to continue to participate in the\n    growth of the business conducted by Microsoft and Visio following the\n    merger and to benefit from the potential appreciation in value of shares\n    of Microsoft common stock; and\n  . the larger public float and trading volumes of shares of Microsoft common\n    stock compared to the public float and trading volumes of shares of Visio\n    common stock, which would provide Visio shareholders, to the extent that\n    they receive Microsoft common stock, with the opportunity to gain greater\n    liquidity in their investment.\n   In the course of deliberations, Visio\'s board also reviewed with its\nexecutive management team and its legal and financial advisors a number of\nadditional factors relevant to the merger, including:\n  . the terms and conditions of the merger agreement, including termination\n    fees and closing conditions;\n  . the likelihood that the merger would be completed;\n  . the expected qualification of the merger as a tax-free reorganization\n    under Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code;\n  . the opinion of Morgan Stanley that, as of the date of the merger\n    agreement and subject to the considerations set forth in the opinion, the\n    0.45 exchange ratio is fair to shareholders of Visio from a financial\n    point of view;\n  . information relating to the business, assets, management, competitive\n    position, operating performance, trading performance and prospects of\n    each of Visio and Microsoft, including the prospects of Visio if it were\n    to continue as an independent company;\n  . current economic and financial market conditions and historical market\n    prices, volatility and trading information for Visio common stock and\n    Microsoft common stock;\n  . the belief, based on presentations by Visio\'s legal and financial\n    advisors, that the terms of the merger agreement and the stock option\n    agreement, including the limited conditions to Microsoft\'s obligation to\n    close the merger and the ability of Visio to consider proposed\n    alternative business combinations under certain circumstances, are\n    generally customary for transactions such as the merger;\n  . whether strategic alternatives to the merger would enhance long-term\n    shareholder value; and\n  . discussions with management and Morgan Stanley as to their due diligence\n    investigations of Microsoft.\n                                       21\n<PAGE>\n   Visio\'s board also considered and balanced against the potential benefits of\nthe merger a number of potentially negative factors, including, without\nlimitation, the following:\n  . the risk that the merger would not be consummated and the effect of the\n    public announcement of the merger on Visio\'s sales and operating results\n    and Visio\'s ability to attract and retain key management, marketing,\n    technical, sales and other personnel;\n  . the possibility that the market value of Microsoft common stock might\n    decrease, causing less aggregate value to be paid to Visio shareholders;\n  . a recognition that Microsoft common stock is traded at high valuation\n    multiples, and the risk that such multiples might not be sustained in the\n    future;\n  . the fact that shareholders of Visio will not receive the full benefit of\n    any future growth in the value of their equity that Visio may have\n    achieved as an independent company, and the potential disadvantage to\n    Visio shareholders who receive Microsoft common stock in the event that\n    Microsoft does not perform as well in the future as Visio may have\n    performed as an independent company;\n  . the possibility that some provisions of the merger agreement, including\n    the no-solicitation and termination fee payment provisions, together with\n    the stock option agreement, might have the effect of discouraging other\n    persons potentially interested in merging with or acquiring Visio from\n    pursuing such an opportunity; and\n  . other matters described in the section entitled ""Risk factors"" on page\n    12.\n   Visio\'s board concluded that overall these risks were outweighed by the\npotential benefits of the merger, and determined that the merger was fair to\nand in the best interests of Visio and its shareholders.\n   The above discussion does not include all of the information and factors\nconsidered by Visio\'s board. In view of the variety of factors considered in\nconnection with its evaluation of the merger agreement, Visio\'s board did not\nfind it practicable to and did not quantify or otherwise assign relative weight\nto the specific factors considered in reaching its determination. In addition,\nindividual members of Visio\'s board may have given different weight to\ndifferent factors.\nRecommendation of Visio\'s board of directors\n   After carefully evaluating these factors, both positive and negative,\nVisio\'s board of directors has determined that the merger is fair to, and in\nthe best interests of, Visio and its shareholders. Visio\'s board of directors\nunanimously recommends that you vote ""FOR"" approval of the merger agreement.\n   Because Robert McDowell, a member of Visio\'s board, is also a Microsoft\nexecutive, he excused himself from all deliberations by Visio\'s board regarding\nthe merger with Microsoft.\nOpinion of Visio\'s financial advisor\n   Under an engagement letter dated August 12, 1999, Visio retained Morgan\nStanley & Co. to provide Visio with financial advisory services and a financial\nfairness opinion in connection with the merger. Visio\'s board of directors\nselected Morgan Stanley to act as its financial advisor based on Morgan\nStanley\'s qualifications, expertise and reputation and its knowledge of Visio\'s\nbusiness and affairs. At the meeting of Visio\'s board of directors on September\n14, 1999, Morgan Stanley rendered its oral opinion, subsequently confirmed in\nwriting, that as of September 14, 1999, based on and subject to the various\nconsiderations described in the opinion, the exchange ratio in the merger\nagreement was fair from a financial point of view to holders of shares of Visio\ncommon stock.\n   We urge you to read the full text of Morgan Stanley\'s written opinion dated\nSeptember 14, 1999, which is attached to this proxy statement/prospectus as\nAnnex C. The description below is only a summary. The opinion\n                                       22\n<PAGE>\ndescribes, among other things, the assumptions made, procedures followed,\nmatters considered and limitations on the scope of the review undertaken by\nMorgan Stanley in rendering its opinion. Morgan Stanley\'s opinion is directed\nto Visio\'s board of directors and addresses only the fairness of the exchange\nratio to Visio\'s shareholders from a financial point of view as of the date of\nthe opinion. It does not address any other aspect of the merger and is not a\nrecommendation to any holder of Visio common stock as to how to vote at the\nspecial meeting.\n   In connection with rendering its opinion, Morgan Stanley, among other\nthings:\n  . reviewed certain publicly available financial statements and other\n    business and financial information of Visio and Microsoft;\n  . reviewed certain internal financial statements and other financial and\n    operating data concerning Visio prepared by Visio\'s management;\n  . discussed with Visio\'s senior executives the past and current operations\n    and financial condition and the prospects of Visio, including information\n    relating to strategic, financial and operational benefits anticipated\n    from the merger;\n  . discussed with senior executives of Microsoft the past and current\n    operations and financial condition and the prospects of Microsoft,\n    including information relating to certain strategic, financial and\n    operational benefits anticipated from the merger;\n  . reviewed and discussed with the senior managements of Visio and Microsoft\n    their strategic rationales for the merger;\n  . reviewed the pro forma impact of the merger on the earnings per share of\n    Microsoft;\n  . reviewed the reported prices and trading activity for Visio common stock\n    and Microsoft common stock;\n  . compared the financial performance of Visio and Microsoft and the prices\n    and trading activity of Visio common stock and Microsoft common stock\n    with that of a number of other publicly traded companies comparable with\n    Visio and Microsoft and their securities;\n  . reviewed the financial terms, to the extent publicly available, of a\n    number of comparable acquisition transactions;\n  . participated in discussions and negotiations among representatives of\n    Visio and Microsoft and their financial and legal advisors;\n  . reviewed the draft merger agreement and certain related agreements; and\n  . performed other analyses that Morgan Stanley deemed appropriate.\n   Morgan Stanley assumed and relied upon, without independent verification,\nthe accuracy and completeness of the information it reviewed for its opinion.\nWith respect to the internal financial statements and other financial and\noperating data that Visio provided and the discussions with Visio relating to\nthe strategic, financial and operational benefits anticipated from the merger,\nMorgan Stanley assumed that Visio had, in each case, reasonably prepared them\non bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of the\nprospects of Visio and Microsoft. Morgan Stanley also relied upon, without\nindependent verification, the assessment by the managements of Visio and\nMicrosoft of:\n  . the ability of Microsoft and Visio to retain key Visio employees;\n  . the strategic, financial, operational and other benefits expected to\n    result from the merger;\n  . the timing and risks associated with the integration of Visio and\n    Microsoft; and\n  . the validity of, and risks associated with, Visio\'s and Microsoft\'s\n    existing and future services, technologies and business models.\n                                       23\n<PAGE>\n   Morgan Stanley did not make any independent valuation or appraisal of the\nassets or liabilities or technology of Visio and Microsoft, nor has Morgan\nStanley been furnished with any such appraisals. In addition, Morgan Stanley\nassumed, among other things, that the merger will be consummated in accordance\nwith the terms of the merger agreement and that the merger will be accounted\nfor as a pooling-of-interests business combination in accordance with generally\naccepted accounting principles and that the merger will be treated as a tax-\nfree reorganization or exchange under the Internal Revenue Code. Morgan\nStanley\'s opinion is necessarily based on financial, economic, market and other\nconditions as in effect on, and the information made available to it as of,\nSeptember 14, 1999.\n   The following is a brief summary of analyses performed by Morgan Stanley in\nconnection with its oral opinion and the preparation of its opinion letter. In\nsome cases, the summary of financial analyses includes information presented in\ntabular format. The tables alone are not a complete description of the\nfinancial analyses, and in order to fully understand the financial analyses\nused by Morgan Stanley, you should read the tables together with the text of\neach summary.\n   Visio stock price performance.

In evaluating the comparable companies, Morgan Stanley made\njudgments and assumptions with regard to industry performance, general\nbusiness, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters, many of\nwhich are beyond the control of Visio and Microsoft. These matters include the\nimpact of competition on the businesses of Visio and Microsoft and the industry\nin general, industry growth and the absence of any adverse material change in\nthe financial condition and prospects of Visio and Microsoft or the industry or\nin the financial markets in general. Mathematical analysis, such as determining\nthe average or median, is not in itself a meaningful method of using comparable\ncompanies data.\n   Discounted analyst price targets. Morgan Stanley performed an analysis of\nthe present value of research analysts\' 12-month price targets of Visio common\nstock. At a discount rate of 16%, the discounted analyst price target range as\nof September 10, 1999 is $31 to $44.\n   Exchange ratio analysis.

The following table\npresents the discounted equity value of Visio common stock based on the\nspecified assumed variable ranges:\n<TABLE>\n<CAPTION>\n                                                                   Fully Diluted\n   Next 12 Months                                         Discount   Price per\n   P/E Ratio                                               Rates       Share\n   --------------                                         -------- -------------\n   <S>                                                    <C>      <C>\n   15x-25x..............................................  16%-20%  $32.14-$53.56\n</TABLE>\n                                       26\n<PAGE>\n   Pro forma merger analysis. Morgan Stanley analyzed the pro forma impact of\nthe merger on Microsoft\'s combined projected earnings per share for calendar\nyears 1999 and 2000. This analysis was based on average earnings projections by\nsecurities research analysts for Visio and Microsoft. Morgan Stanley observed\nthat the merger would result in earnings per share accretion for Microsoft,\nbefore giving effect to any synergies, of 0.3% for calendar year 1999 and 0.4%\nfor calendar year 2000.\n   The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and is not\nnecessarily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. In arriving\nat its opinion, Morgan Stanley considered the results of all of its analyses as\na whole and did not attribute any particular weight to any analysis or factor\nit considered. Furthermore, Morgan Stanley believes that selecting any portion\nof its analyses, without considering all analyses, would create an incomplete\nview of the process underlying its opinion. In addition, Morgan Stanley may\nhave given various analyses and factors more or less weight than other analyses\nand factors, and may have deemed various assumptions more or less probable than\nother assumptions, so that the ranges of valuations resulting from any\nparticular analysis described above should not be taken to be Morgan Stanley\'s\nview of the actual value of Visio or Microsoft. In performing its analyses,\nMorgan Stanley made numerous assumptions with respect to industry performance,\ngeneral business and economic conditions and other matters, many of which are\nbeyond the control of Visio or Microsoft. Any estimates contained in Morgan\nStanley\'s analyses are not necessarily indicative of future results or actual\nvalues, which may be significantly more or less favorable than those suggested\nby those estimates.\n   The analyses performed were prepared solely as part of Morgan Stanley\'s\nanalysis of the fairness of the exchange ratio in the merger agreement to\nholders of Visio common stock from a financial point of view and were conducted\nin connection with the delivery of the opinion to Visio\'s board of directors.\nThe analyses do not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at which\nVisio or Microsoft might actually be sold.\n   The exchange ratio was determined through arm\'s-length negotiations between\nVisio and Microsoft and was approved by Visio\'s board of directors. Morgan\nStanley gave Visio advice during those negotiations, but Morgan Stanley did not\nrecommend any specific consideration or exchange ratio or state that any\nspecific consideration or exchange ratio was the only appropriate consideration\nor exchange ratio for the merger.\n   In addition, Morgan Stanley\'s opinion and presentation to Visio\'s board of\ndirectors was only one of many factors taken into consideration by the board in\nmaking its decision to approve the merger. Consequently, Morgan Stanley\'s\nopinion should not be viewed as determinative of the opinion of Visio\'s board\nof directors with respect to the exchange ratio or of whether the board would\nhave been willing to agree to a different consideration or exchange ratio.\n   Visio\'s board of directors retained Morgan Stanley based upon Morgan\nStanley\'s qualifications, experience and expertise. Morgan Stanley is an\ninternationally recognized investment banking and advisory firm. As part of its\ninvestment banking business, Morgan Stanley is continuously engaged in the\nvaluation of businesses and securities in connection with mergers and\nacquisitions, negotiated underwritings, competitive biddings, secondary\ndistributions of listed and unlisted securities, private placements and\nvaluations for corporate, estate and other purposes. In the past, Morgan\nStanley and its affiliates have provided financing services and financial\nadvisory services for Microsoft and have received fees for these services. In\nthe ordinary course of Morgan Stanley\'s trading and brokerage activities,\nMorgan Stanley or its affiliates may at any time hold long or short positions\nor may trade or otherwise effect transactions, for its own account or for the\naccounts of customers, in the equity securities of Visio, Microsoft or any\nother parties involved in the transaction.\n   Under the engagement letter, Morgan Stanley provided financial advisory\nservices and a financial fairness opinion to Visio in connection with the\nmerger, and Visio agreed to pay Morgan Stanley a customary fee. Visio has also\nagreed to reimburse Morgan Stanley for its expenses incurred in performing its\nservices. In addition, Visio has also agreed to indemnify Morgan Stanley and\nits affiliates, their respective directors, officers, agents and employees and\neach person, if any, controlling Morgan Stanley or any of its affiliates\nagainst specific liabilities and expenses, including specific liabilities under\nthe federal securities laws, related to or arising out of Morgan Stanley\'s\nengagement.\n                                       27\n<PAGE>\nMicrosoft\'s reasons for the merger\n   Microsoft\'s board of directors has determined that the merger is in the best\ninterests of Microsoft and its shareholders. Microsoft\'s board of directors has\napproved the merger and the issuance of shares of Microsoft common stock in the\nmerger.\n   In reaching its determination, Microsoft\'s board of directors identified the\nfollowing reasons, among others, for entering into the merger agreement:\n  . Visio has built a strong business and has developed a strong set of\n    products in the market for general-purpose diagramming tools and\n    Microsoft does not have a similar product offering;\n  . the nature of Visio\'s products and its customers creates a natural\n    complement to the Microsoft Office business. Specifically, (a) Visio, a\n    highly regarded general purpose productivity tool, should appeal to\n    Office customers and (b) Visio\'s products will not require substantial\n    redevelopment because they already implement various Microsoft Office\n    technologies;\n  . in Microsoft\'s opinion, Visio\'s future growth prospects will be derived\n    in enterprise licensing to corporate customers, as opposed to retail\n    sales. Microsoft believes that the merger will allow it to accelerate\n    distribution of Visio\'s products through the efforts of Microsoft\'s\n    existing sales force, and thereby increase revenues from Visio\'s existing\n    and future products; and\n  . Visio has a strong engineering and management team based in Seattle that\n    will complement the continued development of the Visio business, going\n    forward, as a division of Microsoft.\nStructure of the merger; completion and effectiveness of the merger\n   The merger agreement provides for the merger of MovieSub, Inc., a wholly\nowned subsidiary of Microsoft, with and into Visio. Before the effective time\nof the merger, Microsoft, MovieSub, Inc. and Visio will be separate entities.\n   The merger will be completed when all of the conditions to completion of the\nmerger are satisfied or waived, including approval of the merger agreement by\nVisio\'s shareholders. If all conditions are satisfied before December 30, 1999,\nhowever, Microsoft may elect to postpone the closing of the merger to a date\nnot later than December 30, 1999. If Microsoft so elects, the obligations of\neach party to effect the merger will no longer be subject to any of the\nconditions specified in the merger agreement.\n   At the effective time of the merger, which occurs the day that articles of\nmerger and an agreement and plan of merger are filed with the Secretary of\nState of the state of Washington, MovieSub, Inc. and Visio will merge. Visio\nwill survive the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Microsoft.\nMerger consideration; conversion of Visio common stock\n   At the effective time of the merger, each outstanding share of Visio common\nstock will be automatically converted into the right to receive 0.45 of a share\nof Microsoft common stock. You will receive cash for any fractional share you\nwould otherwise receive in the merger. The exchange ratio of 0.45 was\ndetermined through arm\'s-length negotiations between Microsoft and Visio.\n   The amount of cash that Microsoft will pay you in lieu of a fractional share\nis equal to the average closing price of Microsoft common stock on the Nasdaq\nStock Market over the 20 trading days ending on the fifth trading day before\nthe closing date, multiplied by the fraction of a share of Microsoft common\nstock to which you would otherwise be entitled. Visio shareholders will not\nreceive interest on cash payments in lieu of fractional shares.\n   The conversion of Visio common stock into the right to receive Microsoft\ncommon stock will occur automatically at the effective time of the merger. At\nthat time, all shares of Visio common stock will no longer\n                                       28\n<PAGE>\nbe outstanding, will automatically be canceled and will cease to exist. Subject\nto the dissenters\' rights described elsewhere in this proxy\nstatement/prospectus, each holder of a certificate representing shares of Visio\ncommon stock will cease to have any rights as a shareholder except the right to\nreceive the Microsoft common stock into which those shares were converted in\nthe merger and the right to receive cash for any fractional share of Microsoft\ncommon stock.\nTreatment of options and employee stock purchase and benefit plans\n   At the effective time of the merger, each then-outstanding option to\npurchase shares of Visio common stock will be assumed by Microsoft and will\nautomatically become an option to purchase shares of Microsoft common stock.\nThe number of shares of Microsoft common stock for which the assumed option\nwill be exercisable will be determined by multiplying the number of Visio\nshares subject to the option by 0.45, and the per share exercise price will be\ndetermined by dividing the per share exercise price of the Visio option by\n0.45. To avoid options to purchase fractional shares, the number of shares of\nMicrosoft common stock subject to an assumed option will be rounded to the\nnearest whole share. Except for vesting of options granted to Visio directors,\nthe other terms of the assumed Visio options, including exercisability and\nvesting schedules, will remain unchanged. Microsoft will issue the shares of\nMicrosoft common stock issuable upon the exercise of assumed Visio options\nunder Microsoft\'s amended 1991 Stock Option Plan, which is subject to a\ncurrently effective registration statement on Form S-8 filed with the SEC.\nAlternatively, Microsoft may file a registration statement with the SEC to\nregister the shares of Microsoft common stock to be issued upon exercise of the\nassumed Visio options, and will use its commercially reasonable best efforts to\nmaintain the effectiveness of the registration statement for as long as any\nassumed Visio options remain outstanding.\n   Visio will terminate its 1995 Employee Stock Purchase Plan as of the day\nbefore the merger becomes effective. This termination will not result in any\nloss of rights for those employees who purchased stock under this plan. On the\ndate of the termination of the plan, all funds that have been withheld from the\nwages of Visio employees for the purchase of Visio common stock under the plan\nwill be applied to a final purchase under the plan.\n   Immediately before the effective time of the merger, Visio will terminate or\nmodify according to Microsoft\'s direction all of Visio\'s employee benefit\nplans. Microsoft has agreed to offer Visio employees who remain at Microsoft\nbenefits commensurate with the benefits it gives to similarly situated\nMicrosoft employees. To the extent that length of service determines\neligibility, vesting or benefit accruals under any Microsoft employee benefit\nplan, Microsoft will credit former Visio employees for any service credit\nrecognized by Visio or its subsidiaries.\nInterests of Visio\'s directors and executive officers in the merger\n   When considering the recommendation of Visio\'s board of directors, you\nshould be aware that some of Visio\'s directors and executive officers have\ninterests in the merger and have arrangements that are different from, or are\nin addition to, their interests as shareholders of Visio generally. These\ninclude, among other things, indemnification rights, potential acceleration of\noption vesting and other benefits and payments under certain agreements and\nemployee benefit and retention plans.\n  . Stock ownership. As of October 21, 1999, the record date, Visio\'s\n    directors and executive officers collectively owned 4,206,137 shares, or\n    approximately 14%, of Visio\'s outstanding common stock (not including\n    options, which are described below).\n  . Stock options. Under the terms of the merger agreement, at the time the\n    merger is completed, each outstanding option to purchase shares of Visio\n    common stock issued to employees and directors of Visio will be assumed\n    by Microsoft and will automatically become an option to purchase shares\n    of Microsoft common stock. The terms of an assumed Visio option held by a\n    Visio employee or officer will not be affected by the merger, except that\n    the number of shares subject to the option and the exercise price per\n    share will be adjusted to reflect the exchange ratio. In accordance with\n    the provisions of Visio\'s 1995\n                                       29\n<PAGE>\n    Long-Term Incentive Compensation Plan, vesting of options will accelerate\n    if, within two years following the approval of the merger by Visio\'s\n    shareholders, an option holder\'s employment terminates under specified\n    qualifying circumstances. In accordance with the provisions of Visio\'s 1995\n    Stock Option Plan for Nonemployee Directors, any outstanding options granted\n    under that plan that are not otherwise vested will become fully vested and\n    exercisable immediately before the effective time of the merger.\n    As of the record date, directors and executive officers of Visio\n    collectively held outstanding options to purchase 1,267,500 shares of Visio\n    common stock. Of these options, 550,997 were vested as of the record date.\n    The vesting of the remaining 40,500 options held by nonemployee directors\n    will accelerate at the effective time of the merger. To the extent they have\n    not already vested in accordance with their terms, the vesting of the\n    remaining 676,003 options held by Visio executive officers could accelerate\n    during the two-year period following the completion of the merger if the\n    option holder\'s employment terminates under specified qualifying\n    circumstances.\n  . Employment offer letters; nonemployee directors. Microsoft has issued\n    offer letters to Jeremy Jaech, Visio\'s president and chief executive\n    officer, and Ted Johnson, Visio\'s executive vice president and chief\n    technology officer. Under the terms of these offer letters, Mr. Jaech and\n    Mr. Johnson would each serve as a vice president of Microsoft after the\n    closing of the merger and would be paid an annual salary of $200,000 and\n    $190,000, respectively. In addition, Mr. Jaech and Mr. Johnson would\n    receive options to purchase 40,000 and 35,000 shares of Microsoft common\n    stock, respectively. Microsoft does not plan to retain any nonemployee\n    directors of Visio following completion of the merger.\n  . Microsoft retention and transition bonus plan. In accordance with the\n    merger agreement, Microsoft has implemented a retention plan for Visio\n    executives. Under the plan, each Visio executive, other than Messrs.\n    Jaech and Johnson, who six months after the closing of the merger either\n    is not offered a position with Microsoft or rejects the position offered,\n    will receive a retention bonus equal to 40% of his or her annual base\n    salary, provided that the executive has not voluntarily terminated his or\n    her employment with Microsoft and has not been terminated for cause\n    before that time. Each Visio executive, other than Messrs. Jaech and\n    Johnson, who six months after the closing of the merger has accepted a\n    position with Microsoft, will receive a signing bonus equal to 60% of his\n    or her annual base salary and will be eligible to receive additional\n    signing bonuses equal to 20% of his or her annual base salary at six-\n    month intervals through the second anniversary of the closing of the\n    merger, provided the executive has not voluntarily terminated his or her\n    employment before that time. Six months following the closing of the\n    merger, or such earlier date as may be determined by a transition\n    committee established by Microsoft and Visio, these executives, other\n    than Messrs. Jaech and Johnson, also will be entitled to receive a\n    transition bonus equal to 40% of his or her base salary.\n  . Severance. In addition to amounts that may be payable under the retention\n    and transition bonus plan described in the preceding paragraph, the Visio\n    executives will be entitled to receive a severance package that includes\n    a payment of six weeks\' base salary plus Microsoft\'s standard severance.\n    Microsoft\'s standard severance includes two weeks\' base salary for every\n    six months of service, capped at 26 weeks. The 26-week cap does not\n    include the six weeks\' base salary payment. If Microsoft\'s standard\n    severance is less than six months\' base salary, Microsoft will make a\n    supplemental payment for the difference. The executives are also entitled\n    to outplacement assistance.\n  . Visio retention plan. If the merger does not close before June 1, 2000,\n    each executive, other than Messrs. Jaech and Johnson, will be entitled to\n    receive a ""stay bonus"" equal to 40% of his or her base salary. The stay\n    bonus will not be paid if the merger closes before June 1, 2000.\n  . Indemnification and insurance. Microsoft has agreed that if the merger is\n    completed, all rights to indemnification (including advancement of\n    expenses) of current or former directors, officers and employees of Visio\n    and its subsidiaries arising from actions taken before the consummation\n    of the merger, as provided in Visio\'s articles of incorporation and\n    bylaws and existing indemnification agreements, will be assumed by\n    Microsoft, will continue in full force and effect for six years from the\n    effective date of the merger and will be guaranteed by Microsoft.\n                                       30\n<PAGE>\n   Visio\'s board of directors was aware of and considered the interests of\nVisio\'s directors and executive officers in approving the merger agreement and\nrecommending that Visio\'s shareholders approve the merger agreement.\nRestrictions on sales by affiliates of Visio and Microsoft\n   All shares of Microsoft common stock received by Visio shareholders in\nconnection with the merger will be freely transferable unless the shareholder\nis considered an affiliate of either Visio or Microsoft under the Securities\nAct.\n   Shares of Microsoft common stock held by affiliates may be sold only under a\nregistration statement or an exemption from registration under the Securities\nAct. In addition, each of Visio\'s executive officers and directors, each of\nwhom may be deemed to be an ""affiliate"" of Visio, as that term is defined under\nRule 145 of the Securities Act, signed a letter agreement with Microsoft,\nagreeing that:\n  . for 30 days before the merger, the affiliate will not sell, transfer or\n    otherwise dispose of (except by gift) or reduce his or her risk in (as\n    defined by SEC accounting rules) more than a de minimus number of the\n    shares of Visio common stock or Microsoft capital stock held by the\n    affiliate; and\n  . until Microsoft has publicly filed or announced results covering at least\n    30 days of combined operations of Microsoft and Visio, the affiliate will\n    not sell, otherwise dispose of or reduce his or her risk in more than a\n    de minimus number of the shares of Microsoft common stock that the\n    affiliate receives in the merger.\n   In return, Microsoft has agreed to publish results of operations covering at\nleast 30 days of combined operations as soon as practicable after the end of a\ncalendar month that is at least 30 days after the effective time of the merger.\nThe results of operations may be in the form of an earnings report, an\neffective registration statement or report filed with the SEC, or any other\npublic filing or announcement that includes sales and net income.\n   Each Visio affiliate also agreed that he or she will sell, offer to sell or\notherwise dispose of any Microsoft common stock issued in connection with the\nmerger only under an effective registration statement or in compliance with\nRule 145 or other exemption from registration under the Securities Act.\nMicrosoft has agreed to use its reasonable efforts to permit affiliate sales\nunder Rule 145 and Rule 144 and to file all reports required to be filed under\nthe Securities Exchange Act of 1934.\nMaterial United States federal income tax consequences of the merger\n   The following discussion summarizes the material United States federal\nincome tax consequences to Visio and Visio\'s shareholders in connection with\nthe merger. This summary does not purport to be a complete analysis or listing\nof all of the potential tax effects of the merger. It does not deal with all\nfederal income tax considerations that may be relevant to some Visio\nshareholders in light of their particular circumstances, such as dealers in\nsecurities, shareholders who do not hold their Visio common stock as capital\nassets, foreign persons, tax-exempt entities, or persons who are subject to the\nalternative minimum tax provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. Furthermore,\nit does not address the tax consequences particular to Visio shareholders who\nacquired their shares in connection with stock options or stock purchase plans\nor in other compensatory transactions, and does not address the effects of the\nmerger on holders of Visio stock options. Moreover, it does not address the tax\nconsequences of the merger under foreign, state or local tax laws.\nYOU SHOULD CONSULT YOUR OWN TAX ADVISOR AS TO THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER,\nINCLUDING THE UNITED STATES FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL AND FOREIGN TAX CONSEQUENCES\nAPPLICABLE TO YOU.\n   It is a condition to the merger that Visio receive an opinion from Shearman\n& Sterling that the merger will constitute a reorganization under section 368\nof the Code. Microsoft will receive a similar opinion from its\n                                       31\n<PAGE>\ncounsel. The tax opinion will be based on and subject to certain assumptions\nand limitations as well as factual representations received from Visio and\nMicrosoft, as discussed below. An opinion of counsel represents only counsel\'s\nbest legal judgment and has no binding effect or official status of any kind,\nand contrary positions may be taken by the Internal Revenue Service or a court\nconsidering the issues. Neither Visio nor Microsoft has requested or will\nrequest a ruling from the IRS with regard to any of the United States federal\nincome tax consequences of the merger. The tax opinion and this discussion are\nbased on currently existing provisions of the Code, existing and proposed\nTreasury regulations and current administrative rulings and court decisions.\nFuture legislative, judicial or administrative changes or interpretations may\nadversely affect the accuracy of the tax opinion or of the statements and\nconclusions in this discussion. Any such changes or interpretations could be\napplied retroactively and could affect the tax consequences of the merger.\n   Assuming the merger qualifies as a tax-free reorganization, the material\nUnited States federal income tax consequences of the merger are as follows:\n  . Nature of the merger. Visio, Microsoft and MovieSub will each be ""a party\n    to a reorganization"" within the meaning of section 368(b) of the Code if\n    the merger is carried out in the manner provided in the merger agreement.\n  . Consequences to Visio. Visio will not recognize gain or loss upon\n    Microsoft\'s issuance of Microsoft common stock to Visio\'s shareholders in\n    the merger and the transfer by operation of law of MovieSub\'s assets and\n    liabilities to Visio upon consummation of the merger.\n  . Consequences to Visio\'s shareholders. No gain or loss will be recognized\n    by Visio\'s shareholders upon their receipt in the merger of Microsoft\n    common stock, except to the extent of cash received in lieu of fractional\n    shares of Microsoft common stock.\n   The aggregate tax basis of the Microsoft common stock you receive in the\nmerger (including any fractional share deemed received) will be the same as the\naggregate tax basis of the Visio common stock you surrendered in exchange for\nthe Microsoft common stock. The holding period of each share of Microsoft\ncommon stock you receive in the merger will include the period during which you\nheld your Visio common stock.\n   Cash payments in lieu of a fractional share should be treated as if a\nfractional share of Microsoft common stock had been issued in connection with\nthe merger and then redeemed by Microsoft. If you receive cash, you should\ngenerally recognize a gain or loss at the time of that payment equal to any\ndifference between the amount of cash received and your basis in the fractional\nshare (which will be a pro rata portion of your basis in the Microsoft common\nstock received in the merger).\n   If you receive solely cash for your Visio common stock by exercising\ndissenters\' rights, you will be obligated to report either (a) capital gain or\nloss equal to the difference between the cash you received and your basis in\nyour Visio common stock or (b) dividend income, depending on whether the deemed\nredemption resulting from the exercise of dissenters\' rights qualifies for sale\nor exchange treatment under the tests set forth in section 302(b) of the Code.\nUnder those tests, most Visio shareholders who exercise their dissenters\'\nrights should receive capital gain or loss treatment, rather than dividend\ntreatment, if the deemed redemption of their Visio common stock constitutes a\n""complete redemption"" of their interests in Visio (and Microsoft, after the\nmerger). To the extent that persons related to any such shareholder continue to\nhold stock in Microsoft after the merger, the rules of section 318 of the Code\nmay require dividend treatment unless section 302 of the Code permits those\nrules to be waived in a particular instance.\n   Limitations on opinion and discussion. A successful challenge by the IRS to\nthe tax-free reorganization status of the merger would result in Visio\'s\nshareholders recognizing a taxable gain or loss for each share of Visio common\nstock surrendered, equal to the difference between the shareholder\'s basis in\nthat share and the fair market value, as of the effective date of the merger,\nof the Microsoft common stock received in exchange for the Visio share, plus\nany cash received. This gain or loss would be treated as capital gain or loss\nfor each\n                                       32\n<PAGE>\nshareholder. In that event, a shareholder\'s aggregate basis in Microsoft common\nstock received would equal its fair market value at the effective date of the\nmerger and the holding period for the stock would begin on the day after the\neffective date of the merger.\nAccounting treatment of the merger\n   Microsoft expects to account for the merger using the pooling-of-interests\nmethod of accounting in accordance with generally accepted accounting\nprinciples. Under the pooling-of-interests method of accounting, the assets,\nliabilities and shareholders\' equity of Visio and Microsoft will be carried\nforward by Microsoft at their recorded amounts. Microsoft has reserved the\nright, however, to cause the merger to be accounted for as a purchase.\n   Microsoft\'s obligation to effect the merger, but not Visio\'s, is subject to\nthe receipt by Microsoft of a letter from Ernst & Young LLP, addressed to\nVisio, regarding that firm\'s concurrence with the conclusion of Visio\'s\nmanagement that Visio meets the conditions necessary for it to enter into the\nbusiness combination accounted for as a pooling of interests.\nRegulatory filings and approvals required to complete the merger\n   Under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended,\ncertain acquisition transactions, including the merger, cannot be consummated\nunless specified information has been furnished to the Federal Trade Commission\nand the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice and\nspecific waiting period requirements have been satisfied. Under the Hart-Scott-\nRodino Act, the merger may not be consummated until the expiration of at least\n30 days following the receipt of the filing, unless the waiting period is\nearlier terminated by the FTC or the Antitrust Division or extended by the\nissuance of a request for additional information and documents. On October 29,\n1999, the Antitrust Division issued requests for additional information and\ndocuments to both Microsoft and Visio. The requests extend the waiting period\nunder the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act for a period ending 20 days after both parties\nhave filed a proper response. The FTC and the Antitrust Division are charged\nwith enforcing antitrust laws concerning transactions such as the merger. At\nany time before or after the consummation of the merger, the FTC or the\nAntitrust Division could take such action under the antitrust laws as it deems\nappropriate, including seeking to enjoin the consummation of the merger or\nseeking the divestiture of assets of Visio or Microsoft. Visio and Microsoft\nbelieve that the proposed merger does not violate the antitrust laws. However,\na challenge to the merger on antitrust grounds could be made. If such a\nchallenge is made, it is uncertain what the results would be. Due to the\ninternational scope of Microsoft\'s and Visio\'s businesses, regulatory filings\nmay also be required in certain European and other jurisdictions. Microsoft and\nVisio do not expect those filings to affect the expected timing of the merger.\nOther than as described in this paragraph and the filing of the actual merger\ndocuments with the Secretary of State of the state of Washington, Microsoft and\nVisio believe that the merger does not require the approval of any federal,\nstate or other agency.\nExchange of Visio stock certificates for Microsoft stock certificates\n   After the closing of the merger, Microsoft will send a letter of transmittal\nto all former Visio shareholders.

While we believe that the description covers the material terms of\nthe merger agreement, as amended, this summary may not contain all of the\ninformation that is important to you. We urge you to carefully read the merger\nagreement, which is attached to this proxy statement/prospectus as Annex A.\nConditions to completion of the merger\n   The obligations of each of Microsoft and Visio to effect the merger are\nsubject to the satisfaction before the closing date of specific conditions, any\nor all of which may be waived, including:\n  . the approval by Visio\'s shareholders of the merger agreement as required\n    by Washington law;\n  . the obtaining of all legally required consents and approvals, including\n    expiration of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino\n    Act, except when the failure to obtain a consent would not have a\n    material adverse effect on the consummation of the merger or the business\n    condition of Microsoft or Visio;\n  . the effectiveness of the registration statement relating to the Microsoft\n    common stock to be issued in connection with the merger;\n  . the absence of any statute, rule, regulation, order, decree or injunction\n    prohibiting the merger;\n  . the absence of any material adverse change with respect to Visio\'s\n    business condition or the economic and business benefits expected from\n    the merger;\n  . the accuracy of the other party\'s representations and warranties in the\n    agreement, except in respects that do not have a material adverse effect,\n    and the receipt by each party of a certificate to that effect from a\n    designated executive officer of the other party;\n  . the performance by both parties of their obligations under the merger\n    agreement, except for breaches that would not have a material adverse\n    effect on the other party, and the receipt by each party of a certificate\n    to that effect from a designated executive officer of the other party;\n  . the receipt by Microsoft of a letter from Ernst & Young LLP, addressed to\n    Visio, regarding that firm\'s concurrence with the conclusion of Visio\'s\n    management that Visio meets the conditions necessary for it to enter into\n    the business combination accounted for as a pooling of interests;\n  . receipt by each of Visio and Microsoft of an opinion from its tax counsel\n    that the merger will qualify as a tax-free reorganization for federal\n    income tax purposes; and\n  . receipt by each of Visio and Microsoft of a legal opinion from the other\n    party\'s legal counsel.\n   If Microsoft elects to postpone the closing date once these conditions are\nsatisfied, the obligations of each party to effect the merger will no longer be\nsubject to any of the conditions.

and\n  . take any necessary action so that the acquisition of Microsoft common\n    stock or options and the disposition of Visio common stock or options by\n    Visio employees subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act and by Visio\n    directors will be exempt from the short-swing profit liability rules of\n    Section 16(b) and Rule 16b-3 of the Exchange Act.\n   Visio has agreed that it and each of its significant subsidiaries will carry\non their businesses in the ordinary course consistent with past practice, and\nuse all reasonable efforts consistent with past practice to preserve intact\ntheir business organizations, keep their present officers, consultants and\nemployees and preserve their relationships with customers, suppliers,\ndistributors and others having business with them. Visio will promptly notify\nMicrosoft of any event that is not in the ordinary course of business of Visio\nor its subsidiaries and is materially adverse to Visio\'s business condition. In\naddition, Visio has agreed that, except as previously disclosed to Microsoft,\nneither it nor any of its subsidiaries will:\n  . alter or accelerate any exercisability, vesting or similar provisions of\n    stock option or benefit plans or authorize cash payments in exchange for\n    awards under those plans, except in the ordinary course of business;\n  . grant any severance pay to any officer, director or employee, except in\n    the ordinary course consistent with past practice;\n  . transfer to any person or entity any rights to Visio\'s intellectual\n    property;\n  . enter into or amend any agreement granting a third party exclusive\n    marketing or manufacturing rights for more than two years;\n  . commence or settle any claim, action or proceeding, except in the\n    ordinary course of business or in immaterial amounts and except for\n    specified types of lawsuits;\n  . enter into leases that extend beyond September 14, 2004 and obligate\n    Visio to pay aggregate gross rent in excess of $1 million;\n  . declare or pay any dividends or make any other distributions with respect\n    to its capital stock, split or reclassify its capital stock, issue or\n    authorize the issuance of any other securities in respect of or in\n    substitution for its capital stock, or repurchase or otherwise acquire\n    any of its capital stock other than repurchasing vested stock from former\n    employees;\n  . issue or agree to issue any capital stock, options, warrants, calls,\n    conversion rights or other similar securities, subject to certain\n    exceptions;\n  . amend its corporate charter documents;\n  . acquire or agree to acquire any corporation, partnership or other\n    business organization or assets that are material to Visio\'s business\n    condition;\n                                       37\n<PAGE>\n  . dispose of any assets, except in the ordinary course of business or in\n    immaterial amounts;\n  . incur material indebtedness;\n  . enter into or materially amend employee benefit plans or, except in the\n    ordinary course of business, enter into employment agreements or increase\n    employee remuneration; or\n  . knowingly take any action that would disqualify the merger from being\n    accounted for as a pooling of interests.\n   In addition, Visio has agreed that it will:\n  . call a special meeting of Visio shareholders for the consideration and\n    approval of the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the\n    merger agreement;\n  . provide Microsoft with such information for inclusion in this proxy\n    statement/prospectus and the related registration statement as Microsoft\n    may reasonably request;\n  . terminate or modify any employee benefit plans as directed by Microsoft\n    immediately before the effective time of the merger or take such action\n    as may be directed by Microsoft to merge those plans with Microsoft\n    employee benefit plans at the effective time of the merger; and\n  . promptly file all tax returns and pay all taxes required to be filed or\n    paid before the closing of the merger.\n   Microsoft has agreed that it will:\n  . promptly notify Visio of any event or occurrence that is material and\n    adverse to Microsoft\'s business condition;\n  . delay any filings under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act relating to the\n    acquisition by Microsoft or its subsidiaries of any business entity whose\n    products could reasonably be considered to be competitive with Visio\'s,\n    until the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act has expired for\n    the merger;\n  . use its commercially reasonable best efforts to cause the shares of\n    Microsoft common stock to be issued in connection with the merger and\n    upon the exercise of assumed Visio options to be quoted at the effective\n    time on the Nasdaq Stock Market or listed on the same national exchange\n    as Microsoft common stock is listed; and\n  . implement a retention bonus plan and a severance plan for the benefit of\n    Visio employees.\nExclusivity\n   Visio has agreed that it will not, and will use its commercially reasonable\nbest efforts to ensure that none of its officers, directors, agents,\nrepresentatives or affiliates will not, take or cause or permit any subsidiary\nto take any of the following actions with any party other than Microsoft:\n  . solicit, knowingly encourage, initiate or participate in any\n    negotiations, inquiries or discussions regarding any offer or proposal to\n    acquire all or a significant part of Visio\'s or its subsidiaries\'\n    business, assets or capital shares;\n  . enter into any agreement related to such an acquisition;\n  . authorize or announce any public statement, recommendation or\n    solicitation in support of such an acquisition; or\n  . disclose any customarily nonpublic information about Visio in connection\n    with such an acquisition.\nHowever, Visio\'s board of directors may recommend to shareholders that they\ntender their shares in connection with a tender offer by an acquiror other than\nMicrosoft if the board determines in good faith and after\n                                       38\n<PAGE>\nconsultation with legal counsel that its fiduciary duty to its shareholders\nrequires such a recommendation. In addition, the board may give information to\na third party who has made an unsolicited acquisition proposal that the board\nreasonably believes is financially more favorable to Visio and its shareholders\nthan the merger with Microsoft, as long as Visio notifies Microsoft one\nbusiness day before furnishing the information. Visio will promptly inform\nMicrosoft of any inquiry or proposal that it receives with respect to an\nacquisition transaction or any request by any person for nonpublic information\nconcerning Visio or any of its subsidiaries, and will provide Microsoft with\nthe material facts relating to any such offer, proposal or request, including\nthe identity of the third party making the inquiry or proposal. After that\nnotification, Visio is obligated to inform Microsoft of additional material\nfacts as they arise and to provide Microsoft with any additional information\nVisio gives to the third party.\nTermination of the merger agreement\n   Even if Visio\'s shareholders approve the merger agreement, the merger\nagreement may be terminated by the mutual agreement of the parties at any time\nbefore the effective time of the merger. In addition, the merger agreement may\nbe terminated by either Visio or Microsoft under any of the following\ncircumstances:\n  . as a result of a breach of a representation, warranty, covenant or\n    agreement by the other party, if the breach has a material adverse effect\n    on the business of the nonbreaching party and the breach has not been\n    cured or commercially reasonable best efforts are not being employed to\n    cure the breach;\n  . if the merger has not been consummated before March 31, 2000 (subject to\n    extension until September 30, 2000 if Visio and Microsoft have agreed to\n    pursue litigation against any administrative or judicial action or\n    proceeding challenging the merger on the basis that it violates antitrust\n    law);\n  . if Visio shareholders have voted on but not approved the merger\n    agreement; or\n  . if any permanent injunction or other order preventing the merger has\n    become final and non-appealable.\n   In addition, Microsoft may terminate the merger agreement if:\n  . Visio\'s board of directors withdraws or modifies its approval of the\n    merger; or\n  . Visio or its representatives take any action prohibited by the\n    exclusivity provisions of the merger agreement and that action has a\n    material adverse effect on Visio\'s business condition.\nTermination fee\n   Visio has agreed to pay Microsoft a termination fee of $30 million if\nMicrosoft is not then in material breach of the merger agreement and Microsoft\nterminates the agreement for any of the following reasons:\n  . Visio\'s board of directors has withdrawn or modified, in a manner adverse\n    to Microsoft, its approval or recommendation of the merger, and Visio has\n    agreed with any person other than Microsoft to a transaction that will\n    result in a change in the beneficial ownership of more than 50% of the\n    voting power of Visio capital stock;\n  . Visio or its representatives have taken any action prohibited by the\n    exclusivity provisions of the merger agreement and that action has a\n    material adverse effect on Visio\'s business condition; or\n  . Visio has willfully and materially breached its representations,\n    warranties, covenants or agreements and that breach has not been cured as\n    required by the merger agreement.\n   The right to payment of the termination fee is the exclusive remedy at law\nor in equity to which Microsoft may be entitled on termination of the merger\nagreement under the conditions described above. The termination fee may\nincrease the likelihood of the completion of the merger in accordance with the\nterms of the merger agreement. The termination fee may also discourage persons\nfrom making an offer to acquire all of or a significant interest in Visio by\nincreasing the cost of an acquisition.\n                                       39\n<PAGE>\n   If the merger agreement is terminated under circumstances that entitle\nMicrosoft to the termination fee, Microsoft will also be entitled to exercise\nits option to purchase up to 6,012,500 shares of Visio common stock at $42.78\nper share. See the section entitled ""The Visio stock option agreement"" on page\n41.\nExtension; waiver\n   At any time before the effective time of the merger, any party to the\nmerger agreement may, to the extent legally allowed, extend the time for the\nperformance of any other party\'s obligations under the merger agreement, waive\nany inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of any other party in\nthe merger agreement or related documents, and waive compliance with any of\nthe agreements, conditions or covenants in the merger agreement that are for\nthe benefit of the waiving party.\nAmendment to merger agreement\n   On October 29, 1999, Microsoft and Visio amended the merger agreement. The\nmerger agreement originally provided that closing would occur no later than\nthe third business day after satisfaction of the conditions to closing. As\namended, once the conditions to closing have been satisfied Microsoft may\nelect to postpone the closing to a date not later than December 30, 1999. If\nMicrosoft so elects, the obligations of the parties to effect the merger will\nno longer be subject to any of the closing conditions. By the amendment, the\nparties also eliminated a requirement relating to accountants\' comfort\nletters, and Microsoft agreed to publish interim financial results covering 30\ndays of combined operations as soon as practicable after the end of a calendar\nmonth that is at least 30 days after the effective time of the merger.\n   The merger agreement attached to this proxy statement/prospectus as Annex A\nreflects these amendments.\nAdditional amendments\n   The merger agreement may be further amended by Microsoft and Visio at any\ntime before or after approval by Visio\'s shareholders, except that, after\nshareholder approval, Visio and Microsoft may not make any amendment that by\nlaw requires the further approval of Visio\'s shareholders without obtaining\nthat approval.\n                                      40\n<PAGE>\n                               RELATED AGREEMENTS\n   This section of the proxy statement/prospectus describes agreements related\nto the merger agreement, including the stock option agreement, the Visio\nmanagement voting agreements and letters of Visio affiliates. While we believe\nthat these descriptions cover the material terms of these agreements, these\nsummaries may not contain all of the information that is important to you. You\nshould read the related agreements, which are attached to this proxy\nstatement/prospectus or filed as an exhibit to the registration statement filed\nby Microsoft with the SEC, of which this proxy statement/prospectus is a part.\nThe Visio stock option agreement\n   As a condition to Microsoft entering into the merger agreement, Visio\nentered into a stock option agreement with Microsoft. The stock option\nagreement grants Microsoft the option to buy up to 6,012,500 shares of Visio\ncommon stock, which represented 19.9% of the issued and outstanding shares of\nVisio common stock as of September 14, 1999. The exercise price of the option\nis $42.78 per share. The number of shares issuable upon exercise of the option\nand the exercise price of the option are subject to adjustment to prevent\ndilution and to maintain the number of shares issuable upon exercise of the\noption at 19.9% of Visio\'s outstanding common stock.\n   Unless the option is terminated as described below, Microsoft may exercise\nthe option, in whole or part, up to one year from the date on which Microsoft\nhas the right to be paid the termination fee described in the section entitled\n""Termination fee"" on page 39.\n   Microsoft\'s option will terminate upon the earlier of either of the\nfollowing:\n  . the completion of the merger or\n  . the termination of the merger agreement, if the termination occurs before\n    an event that causes the option to become exercisable and in\n    circumstances under which Visio is not required to pay the termination\n    fee.\n   With some exceptions and qualifications, on Microsoft\'s request within 30\ndays of an event that makes the option exercisable, Visio must register at its\nown expense the shares of common stock issued and issuable to Microsoft under\nthe option. Visio must use its best efforts to keep that registration statement\neffective until Microsoft can dispose of the shares issued to it under the\noption, up to a maximum 180 days.\n   If, before the termination of the option, Visio:\n  . merges with an entity other than Microsoft or its subsidiaries, and is\n    not the surviving corporation;\n  . is the surviving corporation in a merger with an entity other than\n    Microsoft or its subsidiaries, after which the then-outstanding shares of\n    Visio common stock represent less than 50% of the outstanding securities\n    of the merged company; or\n  . sells all or substantially all of its assets to an entity other than\n    Microsoft or its affiliates,\nthe agreement governing the transaction must provide that Microsoft\'s option\nwill be converted into an option of, at the election of Microsoft, either the\nacquiring entity or any entity controlling the acquiring entity. On request of\nthe holder of the substitute option, the issuer of the substitute option must\nrepurchase the substitute option from the holder. Visio has agreed not to enter\ninto any of the transactions described above unless the acquiror agrees in\nwriting to assume Visio\'s obligations under the option agreement.\n   The sum of Microsoft\'s total profit arising from the provisions of the\noption agreement and the termination fee provided for in the merger agreement\nmay not exceed $50 million. If Microsoft\'s total profit would exceed that\namount, Microsoft may choose to reduce the number of shares subject to the\noption, have Visio cancel shares of common stock issued to Microsoft, pay cash\nto Visio, or do any combination of these, to reduce its realized profit to no\nmore than $50 million.\n                                       41\n<PAGE>\n   Microsoft intends the option to increase the likelihood that the merger will\nbe completed. The stock option agreement may have the effect of discouraging\npersons who might be interested in acquiring all or a significant interest in\nVisio or Visio\'s assets before completion of the merger by increasing the cost\nof such an acquisition. In addition, if the merger agreement is terminated and\nMicrosoft\'s option becomes exercisable, Visio would not be able to account for\nthe transaction that triggered the exercisability of the option as a pooling of\ninterests.\n   The stock option agreement is attached to this proxy statement/prospectus as\nAnnex B. We urge you to read it carefully and in its entirety.\nVisio management voting agreements\n   As a condition to the merger agreement, Microsoft required Visio\'s directors\nand executive officers to enter into voting agreements. These voting agreements\nrequire Visio\'s directors and executive officers to vote all of the shares of\nVisio common stock they beneficially own in favor of the merger. As of October\n21, 1999, the record date, Visio\'s directors and executive officers\ncollectively owned 4,206,137 shares of Visio common stock, which represented\napproximately 14% of Visio\'s outstanding common stock.\n   Each Visio director and executive officer also agreed not to sell or\notherwise dispose of Visio common stock currently owned or later acquired until\nthe expiration of the voting agreement, unless the sale would not, in\nMicrosoft\'s reasonable judgment, violate the SEC\'s pooling-of-interests rules.\nIn connection with the agreement, Visio\'s directors and executive officers\ngranted an irrevocable proxy to the directors of Microsoft, giving the\nMicrosoft directors the right to vote the shares covered by the voting\nagreement as described above.\n   The voting agreement will expire on the earlier of the termination of the\nmerger agreement in accordance with its terms or the completion of the merger.\nNone of Visio\'s directors or executive officers were paid additional\nconsideration in connection with a voting agreement.\n                                       42\n<PAGE>\n                       COMPARISON OF RIGHTS OF HOLDERS OF\n                 VISIO COMMON STOCK AND MICROSOFT COMMON STOCK\n   After completion of the merger, the holders of Visio common stock will\nbecome shareholders of Microsoft. Because Visio and Microsoft are both\nWashington corporations, the rights of former Visio shareholders will continue\nto be governed by Washington law. Before the merger, the rights of shareholders\nof Visio are governed by Visio\'s articles of incorporation and bylaws. After\nthe merger, as Microsoft shareholders, their rights will be governed by\nMicrosoft\'s articles of incorporation and bylaws, as those documents currently\nexist or may exist in the future.\n   The following discussion summarizes the material differences between the\nrights of holders of Microsoft common stock and holders of Visio common stock\nunder the articles of incorporation and bylaws of Microsoft and Visio. This\nsummary is not complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to\nMicrosoft\'s articles of incorporation and bylaws, Visio\'s articles of\nincorporation and bylaws and the relevant provisions of Washington law. Copies\nof the charter documents are attached as exhibits to Visio\'s and Microsoft\'s\nfilings with the SEC. See ""Documents incorporated by reference into this proxy\nstatement/prospectus"" and ""Where you can find more information"" on page 50.\n   Right to call special meeting of shareholders. The Washington Business\nCorporation Act allows a public company to limit or deny the right of\nshareholders to call a special meeting of shareholders to the extent provided\nin the company\'s articles of incorporation. Visio\'s articles of incorporation\nprovide that, because the company qualifies as a public company, only the board\nof directors or the holders of more than 50% of the shares entitled to vote at\nthe meeting may call a special meeting. Microsoft\'s articles of incorporation\ndeny shareholders the right to call a special meeting by providing that a\nspecial meeting of shareholders may be called only by Microsoft\'s board of\ndirectors or by a duly designated committee of the board.\n   Rights of holders of preferred stock. The WBCA permits a corporation\'s\narticles of incorporation to grant the board of directors the right to\nauthorize and issue series of preferred stock with the preferences,\nlimitations, voting powers and relative rights that the board deems\nappropriate. Both Visio\'s and Microsoft\'s articles of incorporation permit the\nboard of directors to issue preferred stock. No shares of Visio preferred stock\nare currently outstanding, and 12,519,562 shares of Microsoft preferred stock\nwere outstanding as of August 31, 1999. No Microsoft preferred stock will be\nissued in connection with the merger. Holders of Microsoft preferred stock are\nentitled to dividends and preferences upon liquidation that are superior to the\nrights enjoyed by holders of Microsoft common stock.\n   Treasury stock. The WBCA provides that when a corporation acquires its own\nshares from shareholders, those shares become authorized but unissued shares.\nVisio\'s articles of incorporation do not alter this rule. Microsoft\'s articles\nof incorporation provide that, notwithstanding the WBCA, shares acquired by\nMicrosoft are considered treasury stock and are considered to be authorized,\nissued and held by Microsoft.\n                                       43\n<PAGE>\n                    RIGHTS OF DISSENTING VISIO SHAREHOLDERS\n   The following is a brief summary of the rights of holders of Visio common\nstock to dissent from the merger and receive cash equal to the fair value of\ntheir Visio common stock instead of receiving shares of Microsoft common stock.\nThis summary is not exhaustive, and you should read the applicable sections of\nchapter 23B.13 of the WBCA, which is attached to this proxy\nstatement/prospectus as Annex D.\n   If you are contemplating the possibility of dissenting from the merger, you\nshould carefully review the text of Annex D, particularly the procedural steps\nrequired to perfect dissenters\' rights, which are complex. You should also\nconsult your legal counsel. If you do not fully and precisely satisfy the\nprocedural requirements of the WBCA, you will lose your dissenters\' rights.\nRequirements for exercising appraisal rights\n   To exercise dissenters\' rights, you must:\n  . file with Visio before the vote is taken at the special meeting written\n    notice of your intent to demand the fair value for your Visio common\n    stock if the merger is consummated and becomes effective; and\n  . not vote your shares of Visio common stock at the special meeting in\n    favor of the proposal to approve the merger agreement.\n   If you do not satisfy each of these requirements, you cannot exercise\ndissenters\' rights and will be bound by the terms of the merger agreement.\n   Submitting a proxy card that does not direct how the Visio common stock\nrepresented by that proxy is to be voted will constitute a vote in favor of the\nmerger and a waiver of your statutory dissenters\' rights. In addition, voting\nagainst the proposal to approve the merger will not satisfy the notice\nrequirement referred to above. You must file the written notice of the intent\nto exercise dissenters\' rights with Visio at: Visio Corporation, 2211 Elliott\nAvenue, Seattle, WA 98121, Attn: Wm. Kenneth McGraw, General Counsel and\nSecretary.\nAppraisal procedure\n   Within 10 days after the proposed merger has been approved, Visio will send\nwritten notice to all shareholders who have given written notice under the\ndissenters\' rights provisions and have not voted in favor of the merger as\ndescribed above. The notice will contain:\n  . the address where the demand for payment and certificates representing\n    shares of Visio common stock must be sent and the date by which they must\n    be received;\n  . any restrictions on transfer of uncertificated shares that will apply\n    after the demand for payment is received;\n  . a form for demanding payment that states the date of the first\n    announcement to the news media or to shareholders of the proposed merger\n    and requires certification of the date the shareholder, or the beneficial\n    owner on whose behalf the shareholder dissents, acquired the Visio common\n    stock or an interest in it; and\n  . a copy of the dissenters\' rights provisions of the WBCA, attached as\n    Annex D.\n   If you wish to assert dissenters\' rights, you must demand payment and\ndeposit your Visio certificates within 30 days after the notice is given. If\nyou fail to make demand for payment and deposit your Visio certificates within\nthe 30-day period, you will lose the right to receive fair value for your\nshares under the dissenters\' rights provisions, even if you filed a timely\nnotice of intent to demand payment.\n                                       44\n<PAGE>\n   Except as provided below, within 30 days of the later of the effective time\nof the merger or Visio\'s receipt of a valid demand for payment, Visio will\nremit to each dissenting shareholder who complied with the requirements of the\nWBCA the amount Visio estimates to be the fair value of the shareholder\'s Visio\ncommon stock, plus accrued interest. Visio will include the following\ninformation with the payment:\n  . financial data relating to Visio;\n  . Visio\'s estimate of the fair value of the shares and a brief description\n    of the method used to reach that estimate;\n  . a copy of chapter 23B.13 of the WBCA; and\n  . a brief description of the procedures to be followed in demanding\n    supplemental payment.\n   For dissenting shareholders who were not the beneficial owner of the shares\nof Visio common stock before September 15, 1999, Visio may withhold payment and\ninstead send a statement setting forth its estimate of the fair value of their\nshares and offering to pay such amount, with interest, as a final settlement of\nthe dissenting shareholder\'s demand for payment.\n   If you are dissatisfied with your payment or offer, you may, within 30 days\nof the payment or offer for payment, notify Visio in writing of and demand\npayment of your estimate of fair value of your shares and the amount of\ninterest due. If any dissenting shareholder\'s demand for payment is not settled\nwithin 60 days after receipt by Visio of his or her payment demand, section\n23B.13.300 of the WBCA requires that Visio commence a proceeding in King County\nSuperior Court and petition the court to determine the fair value of the shares\nand accrued interest, naming all the dissenting shareholders whose demands\nremain unsettled as parties to the proceeding.\n   The court may appoint one or more appraisers to receive evidence and make\nrecommendations to the court as to the amount of the fair value of the shares.\nThe fair value of the shares as determined by the court is binding on all\ndissenting shareholders and may be less than, equal to or greater than the\nmarket price of the Microsoft common stock to be issued to nondissenting\nshareholders for their Visio common stock if the merger is consummated. If the\ncourt determines that the fair value of the shares is in excess of any amount\nremitted by Visio, then the court will enter a judgment for cash in favor of\nthe dissenting shareholders in an amount by which the value determined by the\ncourt, plus interest, exceeds the amount previously remitted.\n   The court will determine the costs and expenses of the court proceeding and\nassess them against Visio, except that the court may assess part or all of the\ncosts against any dissenting shareholders whose actions in demanding\nsupplemental payments are found by the court to be arbitrary, vexatious or not\nin good faith. If the court finds that Visio did not substantially comply with\nthe relevant provisions of sections 23B.13.200 through 23B.13.280 of the WBCA,\nthe court may also assess against Visio any fees and expenses of attorneys or\nexperts that the court deems equitable. The court may also assess those fees\nand expenses against any party if the court finds that the party has acted\narbitrarily, vexatiously or not in good faith in bringing the proceedings. The\ncourt may award, in its discretion, fees and expenses of an attorney for the\ndissenting shareholders out of the amount awarded to the shareholders, if it\nfinds the services of the attorney were of substantial benefit to the other\ndissenting shareholders and that those fees should not be assessed against\nVisio.\n   A shareholder of record may assert dissenters\' rights as to fewer than all\nof the shares registered in the shareholder\'s name only if he or she dissents\nwith respect to all shares beneficially owned by any one person and notifies\nVisio in writing of the name and address of each person on whose behalf he or\nshe asserts dissenters\' rights. The rights of the partial dissenting\nshareholder are determined as if the shares as to which he or she dissents and\nhis or her other shares were registered in the names of different shareholders.\nBeneficial owners of Visio common stock who desire to exercise dissenters\'\nrights themselves must obtain and submit the registered owner\'s written consent\nat or before the time they file the notice of intent to demand fair value.\n                                       45\n<PAGE>\n   For purposes of the WBCA, ""fair value"" means the value of Visio common stock\nimmediately before the effective time of the merger, excluding any appreciation\nor depreciation in anticipation of the merger, unless that exclusion would be\ninequitable. Under section 23B.13.020 of the WBCA, a Visio shareholder has no\nright, at law or in equity, to set aside the approval and adoption of the\nmerger or the consummation of the merger except if the approval, adoption or\nconsummation fails to comply with the procedural requirements of chapter 23B.13\nof the WBCA, Revised Code of Washington sections 25.10.900 through 25.10.955,\nVisio\'s articles of incorporation or Visio\'s bylaws, or was fraudulent with\nrespect to that shareholder or Visio.\n                                       46\n<PAGE>\n                   SHARE OWNERSHIP OF PRINCIPAL SHAREHOLDERS,\n                       MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS OF VISIO\n   The following table provides information concerning the beneficial ownership\nof Visio common stock as of October 21, 1999, the record date, for the\nfollowing:\n  . each person or entity who is known by Visio to beneficially own more than\n    5% of the outstanding shares of Visio common stock;\n  . each of Visio\'s current directors;\n  . Visio\'s chief executive officer and its five other executive officers;\n    and\n  . all of Visio\'s directors and executive officers as a group.\n   This table includes percentage ownership data reflecting ownership both\nbefore and after consummation of the merger with Microsoft. The pre-merger\npercentage ownership is based on 30,431,714 shares of Visio common stock\noutstanding as of the record date. The post-merger percentage ownership\nincludes only the 13,694,271 shares of Microsoft common stock that would be\nissued to Visio shareholders based on the 30,431,714 shares of Visio common\nstock outstanding as of the record date.

Nothing\ncontained in this Section 1(b) or elsewhere in this Agreement shall be deemed\nto authorize Issuer or Grantee to breach any provision of the Reorganization\nAgreement.\n2. Exercise of Option\n   (a) Grantee may exercise the Option, in whole or part, if, but only if, a\nTriggering Event (as hereinafter defined) shall have occurred prior to the\noccurrence of an Exercise Termination Event (as hereinafter defined), provided\nthat Grantee shall have sent the written notice of such exercise (as provided\nin subsection (d) of this Section 2) on or prior to the last day of the one (1)\nyear period following such Triggering Event (the ""Option Expiration Date"").

Each of the\nfollowing shall be an Exercise Termination Event: (i) the Effective Time of the\nMerger; and (ii) termination of the Reorganization Agreement in accordance with\nthe provisions thereof if such termination occurs prior to the occurrence of a\nTriggering Event in circumstances under which the fee specified in Section\n8.3(b) of the Reorganization Agreement cannot become payable.\n   (b) The term ""Triggering Event"" shall mean the occurrence of any event or\ncircumstance that results in the fee specified in Section 8.3(b) of the\nReorganization Agreement becoming payable to Grantee.\n                                      B-1\n<PAGE>\n   (c) Issuer shall notify Grantee promptly in writing of the occurrence of any\nTriggering Event, it being understood that the giving of such notice by Issuer\nshall not be a condition to the right of Grantee to exercise the Option.\n   (d) In the event Grantee is entitled to and wishes to exercise the Option,\nit shall send to Issuer a written notice (the date of which being herein\nreferred to as the ""Notice Date"") specifying (i) the total number of shares it\nwill purchase pursuant to such exercise and (ii) a place and date not earlier\nthan three business days nor later than 40 business days from the Notice Date\nfor the closing of such purchase (the ""Closing Date""); provided that if prior\nnotification to or approval of any regulatory agency is required in connection\nwith such purchase, Grantee shall promptly file the required notice or\napplication for approval and shall expeditiously process the same and the\nperiod of time that otherwise would run pursuant to this sentence shall run\ninstead from the date on which any required notification periods have expired\nor been terminated or such approvals have been obtained and any requisite\nwaiting period or periods shall have passed. Any exercise of the Option shall\nbe deemed to occur on the Notice Date relating thereto.\n   (e) At the closing referred to in subsection (d) of this Section 2, Grantee\nshall pay to Issuer the aggregate purchase price for the shares of Common Stock\npurchased pursuant to the exercise of the Option in immediately available funds\nby wire transfer to a bank account designated by Issuer, provided that failure\nor refusal of Issuer to designate such a bank account shall not preclude\nGrantee from exercising the Option.\n   (f) At such closing, simultaneously with the delivery of immediately\navailable funds as provided in subsection (e) of this Section 2, Issuer shall\ndeliver to Grantee a certificate or certificates representing the number of\nshares of Common Stock purchased by Grantee and, if the Option should be\nexercised in part only, a new Option evidencing the rights of Grantee thereof\nto purchase the balance of the shares purchasable hereunder, and Grantee shall\ndeliver to Issuer a copy of this Agreement and a letter agreeing that Grantee\nwill not offer to sell or otherwise dispose of such shares in violation of\napplicable law or the provisions of this Agreement.\n   (g) Certificates for Common Stock delivered at a closing hereunder may be\nendorsed with a restrictive legend that shall read substantially as follows:\n     ""The transfer of the shares represented by this certificate is subject\n  to certain provisions of an agreement between the registered holder hereof\n  and Issuer and to resale restrictions arising under the Securities Act of\n  1933, as amended. A copy of such agreement is on file at the principal\n  office of Issuer and will be provided to the holder hereof without charge\n  upon receipt by Issuer of a written request therefor.""\n   It is understood and agreed that: (i) the reference to the resale\nrestrictions of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the ""1933 Act"") in the\nabove legend shall be removed by delivery of substitute certificate(s) without\nsuch reference if Grantee shall have delivered to Issuer a copy of a letter\nfrom the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC""), or an opinion\nof counsel, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Issuer, to the\neffect that such legend is not required for purposes of the 1933 Act; (ii) the\nreference to the provisions to this Agreement in the above legend shall be\nremoved by delivery of substitute certificate(s) without such reference if the\nshares have been sold or transferred in compliance with the provisions of this\nAgreement and under circumstances that do not require the retention of such\nreference; and (iii) the legend shall be removed in its entirety if the\nconditions in the preceding clauses (i) and (ii) are both satisfied. In\naddition, such certificates shall bear any other legend as may be required by\nlaw.\n   (h) Upon the giving by Grantee to Issuer of the written notice of exercise\nof the Option provided for under subsection (d) of this Section 2 and the\ntender of the applicable purchase price in immediately available funds, Grantee\nshall be deemed to be the holder of record of the shares of Common Stock\nissuable upon such exercise, notwithstanding that the stock transfer books of\nIssuer shall then be closed or that certificates representing such shares of\nCommon Stock shall not then be actually delivered to Grantee. Issuer shall pay\nall\n                                      B-2\n<PAGE>\nexpenses, and any and all United States federal, state and local taxes and\nother charges that may be payable in connection with the preparation, issue and\ndelivery of stock certificates under this Section 2 in the name of Grantee or\nits assignee, transferee or designee.\n3. Certain Agreements of Issuer\n   Issuer agrees: (i) that it shall at all times maintain, free from preemptive\nrights, sufficient authorized but unissued or treasury shares of Common Stock\nso that the Option may be exercised without additional authorization of Common\nStock after giving effect to all other options, warrants, convertible\nsecurities and other rights to purchase Common Stock; (ii) that it will not, by\ncharter amendment or through reorganization, consolidation, merger, dissolution\nor sale of assets, or by any other voluntary act, avoid or seek to avoid the\nobservance or performance of any of the covenants, stipulations or conditions\nto be observed or performed hereunder by Issuer; and (iii) promptly to take all\naction as may from time to time be required (including complying with all\npremerger notification, reporting and waiting period requirements specified in\n15 U.S.C. (S) 18a and regulations promulgated thereunder) in order to permit\nGrantee to exercise the Option and Issuer duly and effectively to issue shares\nof Common Stock pursuant hereto.\n4. Replacement Agreements and Options\n   This Agreement (and the Option granted hereby) are exchangeable, without\nexpense, at the option of Grantee, upon presentation and surrender of this\nAgreement at the principal office of Issuer, for other Agreements providing for\nOptions of different denominations entitling the holder thereof to purchase, on\nthe same terms and subject to the same conditions as are set forth herein, in\nthe aggregate the same number of shares of Common Stock purchasable hereunder.\nThe terms ""Agreement"" and ""Option"" as used herein include any Stock Option\nAgreements and related Options for which this Agreement (and the Option granted\nhereby) may be exchanged. Upon receipt by Issuer of evidence reasonably\nsatisfactory to it of the loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of this\nAgreement, and (in the case of loss, theft or destruction) of reasonably\nsatisfactory indemnification, and upon surrender and cancellation of this\nAgreement, if mutilated, Issuer will execute and deliver a new Agreement of\nlike tenor and date.\n5. Anti-Dilution\n   The number of Option Shares purchasable upon the exercise of the Option\nshall be subject to adjustment from time to time as provided in this Section 5.\n   (a) In the event of any change in Common Stock by reason of stock dividends,\nsplit-ups, mergers, recapitalizations, combinations, subdivisions, conversions,\nexchanges of shares or the like, the type and number of shares of Common Stock\npurchasable upon exercise hereof shall be appropriately adjusted.\n   (b) Whenever the number of shares of Common Stock purchasable upon exercise\nhereof is adjusted as provided in this Section 5, the Option Price shall be\nadjusted by multiplying the Option Price by a fraction, the numerator of which\nshall be equal to the number of shares of Common Stock purchasable prior to the\nadjustment and the denominator of which shall be equal to the number of shares\nof Common Stock purchasable after the adjustment.\n   (c) In the event Issuer shall at any time after the date hereof and prior to\nthe Exercise Termination Event issue or distribute any securities or assets in\nrespect of, or in lieu of or in exchange for Common Stock (other than pursuant\nto a dividend paid solely in Common Stock) whether by dividend, in a\nreclassification or recapitalization, or otherwise, Issuer shall make such\nadjustments, if any, in the Option Price and/or the number of shares of Common\nStock issuable upon exercise of the Option as are necessary to fully preserve\nthe interests of the Grantee in the Option.\n                                      B-3\n<PAGE>\n6. Registration Rights\n   Upon the occurrence of a Triggering Event prior to an Exercise Termination\nEvent, Issuer shall, at the request of Grantee delivered within 30 days of such\nTriggering Event (whether on its own behalf or on behalf of any subsequent\nholder of this Option (or part thereof) or any of the shares of Common Stock\nissued pursuant hereto), as promptly as practicable prepare, file and keep\ncurrent, at Issuer\'s expense, a shelf registration under the 1933 Act covering\nany shares issued and issuable pursuant to this Option and shall use its\ncommercially reasonable best efforts to cause such registration statement to\nbecome effective and remain current and effective in order to permit the sale\nor other disposition of any Option Shares in accordance with any plan of\ndistribution reasonably requested by Grantee. Issuer will use its best efforts\nto cause such registration statement first to become effective and then to\nremain effective for such period not in excess of 180 days from the day such\nregistration statement first becomes effective or such shorter time as may be\nnecessary to effect such sales or other dispositions. The obligations of Issuer\nhereunder to file a registration statement and to maintain its effectiveness\nmay be suspended for one or more periods of time not exceeding sixty (60) days\nin the aggregate if the Issuer board of directors shall have determined in good\nfaith that the filing of such registration or the maintenance of its\neffectiveness would require disclosure of nonpublic information that would\nmaterially and adversely affect Issuer or if Issuer is required under the 1933\nAct to include audited financial statements for any period in such registration\nstatement and such financial statements are not yet available for inclusion in\nsuch registration statement. Grantee shall provide all information reasonably\nrequested by Issuer for inclusion in any registration statement to be filed\nhereunder. If requested by any such Grantee in connection with such\nregistration, Issuer shall become a party to any underwriting agreement\nrelating to the sale of such shares, but only to the extent of obligating\nitself in respect of customary representations, warranties, indemnities and\nother agreements customarily included in such underwriting agreements for the\nIssuer. The expenses associated with the preparation and filing of any such\nregistration statement pursuant to this Section 6 (including any fees related\nto blue sky qualifications and filing fees in respect of the SEC or the\nNational Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.) (collectively, the\n""Registration Expenses"") will be for the account of Issuer except for\nunderwriting discounts or commissions or brokers\' fees in respect of shares of\nCommon Stock to be sold by the Grantee and the fees and disbursements of the\nGrantee\'s counsel; provided, however, that Issuer will not be required to pay\nfor any Registration Expenses with respect to such registration if the\nregistration request is subsequently withdrawn at the request of the Grantee;\nprovided further, however, that if at the time of such withdrawal Grantee has\nlearned of a material adverse change in the results of operations, condition,\nbusiness or prospects of Issuer from that known to Grantee at the time of its\nrequest and has withdrawn the request with reasonable promptness following\ndisclosure by Issuer of such material adverse change, then the Grantee will not\nbe required to pay any of such expenses.\n7. Substitute Options\n   (a) In the event that prior to an Exercise Termination Event, Issuer shall\nenter into an agreement other than the Reorganization Agreement (i) to\nconsolidate with or merge into any person, other than Grantee or one of its\nSubsidiaries, and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation of such\nconsolidation or merger, (ii) to permit any person, other than Grantee or one\nof its Subsidiaries, to merge into Issuer and Issuer shall be the continuing or\nsurviving corporation, but, in connection with such merger, the then\noutstanding shares of Common Stock shall be changed into or exchanged for stock\nor other securities of any other person or cash or any other property or the\nthen outstanding shares of Common Stock shall after such merger represent less\nthan 50% of the outstanding shares and share equivalents of the merged company,\nor (iii) to sell or otherwise transfer all or substantially all of its assets\nto any person, other than Grantee or one of its Subsidiaries, then, and in each\nsuch case, the agreement governing such transaction shall make proper provision\nso that the Option shall, upon the consummation of any such transaction and\nupon the terms and conditions set forth herein, be converted into, or exchanged\nfor, an option (the ""Substitute Option""), at the election of Grantee, of either\n(x) the Acquiring Corporation (as hereinafter defined) or (y) any person that\ncontrols the Acquiring Corporation.\n                                      B-4\n<PAGE>\n   (b) The following terms have the meanings indicated:\n       (1) An ""Acquiring Corporation"" shall mean (i) the continuing or\n    surviving corporation of a consolidation or merger with Issuer (if\n    other than Issuer), (ii) Issuer in a merger in which Issuer is the\n    continuing or surviving person, and (iii) the transferee of all or\n    substantially all of Issuer\'s assets.\n       (2) ""Substitute Common Stock"" shall mean the common stock to be\n    issued by the issuer of the Substitute Option upon exercise of the\n    Substitute Option.\n       (3) ""Average Price"" shall mean the average closing price of a share\n    of the Substitute Common Stock for the twenty trading days immediately\n    preceding the fifth business day prior to the consolidation, merger or\n    sale in question, but in no event higher than the closing price of the\n    shares of Substitute Common Stock on the day preceding such\n    consolidation, merger or sale; provided that if Issuer is the issuer of\n    the Substitute Option, the Average Price shall be computed with respect\n    to a share of common stock issued by the person merging into Issuer or\n    by any company which controls or is controlled by such person, as\n    Grantee may elect.\n   (c) The Substitute Option shall have the same terms as the option, provided,\nthat if the terms of the Substitute Option cannot, for legal reasons, be the\nsame as the Option, such terms shall be as similar as possible and in no event\nless advantageous to Grantee. The issuer of the Substitute Option shall also\nenter into an agreement with the then holder or holders of the Substitute\nOption in substantially the same form as this Agreement, which shall be\napplicable to the Substitute Option.\n   (d) The Substitute Option shall be exercisable for such number of shares of\nSubstitute Common Stock as is equal to the Option Price multiplied by the\nnumber of shares of Common Stock for which the Option is then exercisable,\ndivided by the Average Price. The exercise price of the Substitute Option per\nshare of Substitute Common Stock shall then be equal to the Option Price\nmultiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of shares\nof Common Stock for which the Option is then exercisable and the denominator of\nwhich shall be the number of shares of Substitute Common Stock for which the\nSubstitute Option is exercisable.\n   (e) In no event, pursuant to any of the foregoing paragraphs, shall the\nSubstitute Option be exercisable for more than 19.9% of the shares of\nSubstitute Common Stock outstanding prior to exercise of the Substitute Option.\nIn the event that the Substitute Option would be exercisable for more than\n19.9% of the shares of Substitute Common Stock outstanding prior to exercise\nbut for this clause (e), the issuer of the Substitute Option (the ""Substitute\nOption Issuer\') shall make a cash payment to Grantee equal to the excess of (i)\nthe value of the Substitute Option without giving effect to the limitation in\nthis clause (e) over (ii) the value of the Substitute Option after giving\neffect to the limitation in this clause (e). This difference in value shall be\ndetermined by a nationally recognized investment banking firm selected by\nGrantee.\n   (f) Issuer shall not enter into any transaction described in subsection (a)\nof this Section 7 unless the Acquiring Corporation and any person that controls\nthe Acquiring Corporation assume in writing all the obligations of Issuer\nhereunder.\n8. Rights of Substitute Option Holders and Substitute Share Owners\n   (a) At the request of the holder of the Substitute Option (the ""Substitute\nOption Holder""), the issuer of the Substitute Option (the ""Substitute Option\nIssuer"") shall repurchase the Substitute Option from the Substitute Option\nHolder at a price (the ""Substitute Option Repurchase Price"") equal to (x) the\namount by which (i) the Highest Closing Price (as hereinafter defined) exceeds\n(ii) the exercise price of the Substitute Option, multiplied by the number of\nshares of Substitute Common Stock for which the Substitute Option may then be\nexercised plus (y) Grantee\'s Out-of-Pocket Expenses (to the extent not\npreviously reimbursed), and at the request of the owner (the ""Substitute Share\nOwner"") of shares of Substitute Common Stock (the ""Substitute Shares""), the\nSubstitute Option Issuer shall repurchase the Substitute Shares at a price (the\n                                      B-5\n<PAGE>\n""Substitute Share Repurchase Price"") equal to (x) the Highest Closing Price\nmultiplied by the number of Substitute Shares so designated plus (y) Grantee\'s\nOut-of-Pocket Expenses (to the extent not previously reimbursed). The term\n""Highest Closing Price"" shall mean the highest closing price for shares of\nSubstitute Common Stock within the six-month period immediately preceding the\ndate the Substitute Option Holder gives notice of the required repurchase of\nthe Substitute Option or the Substitute Share Owner gives notice of the\nrequired repurchase of the Substitute Shares, as applicable.\n   (b) The Substitute Option Holder or the Substitute Share Owner, as the case\nmay be, may exercise its right to require the Substitute Option Issuer to\nrepurchase the Substitute Option and any Substitute Shares pursuant to this\nSection 8 by surrendering for such purpose to the Substitute Option Issuer, at\nits principal office, the agreement for such Substitute Option (or, in the\nabsence of such an agreement, a copy of this Agreement) or certificates for\nSubstitute Shares, as applicable, accompanied by a written notice or notices\nstating that the Substitute Option Holder or the Substitute Share Owner, as the\ncase may be, elects to require the Substitute Option Issuer to repurchase the\nSubstitute Option and/or the Substitute Shares in accordance with the\nprovisions of this Section 8. As promptly as practicable, and in any event\nwithin five business days after the surrender of the Substitute Option and/or\ncertificates representing Substitute Shares and the receipt of such notice or\nnotices relating thereto, the Substitute Option Issuer shall deliver or cause\nto be delivered to the Substitute Option Holder the Substitute Option\nRepurchase Price and/or to the Substitute Share Owner the Substitute Share\nRepurchase Price therefor or the portion thereof which the Substitute Option\nIssuer is not then prohibited under applicable law and regulation from so\ndelivering.\n   (c) To the extent that the Substitute Option Issuer is prohibited under\napplicable law or regulation from repurchasing the Substitute Option and/or the\nSubstitute Shares in full, the Substitute Option Issuer shall immediately so\nnotify the Substitute Option Holder and/or the Substitute Share Owner and\nthereafter deliver or cause to be delivered, from time to time, to the\nSubstitute Option Holder and/or the Substitute Share Owner, as appropriate, the\nportion of the Substitute Option Repurchase Price and/or Substitute Share\nRepurchase Price, respectively, which it is no longer prohibited from\ndelivering, within five business days after the date on which the Substitute\nOption Issuer is no longer so prohibited; provided, however, that if the\nSubstitute Option Issuer at any time after delivery of a notice of repurchase\npursuant to subsection (b) of this Section 8 is prohibited under applicable law\nor regulation from delivering to the Substitute Option Holder and/or the\nSubstitute Share Owner, as appropriate, the Substitute Option Repurchase Price\nand the Substitute Share Repurchase Price, respectively, in full (and the\nSubstitute Option Issuer shall use its best efforts to obtain all required\nregulatory and legal approvals and to file any required notices as promptly as\npracticable in order to accomplish such repurchase), the Substitute Option\nHolder or Substitute Share Owner may revoke its notice of repurchase of the\nSubstitute Option or the Substitute Shares either in whole or to the extent of\nthe prohibition, whereupon, in the latter case, the Substitute Option Issuer\nshall promptly (i) deliver to the Substitute Option Holder or Substitute Share\nOwner, as appropriate, that portion of the Substitute Option Repurchase Price\nor the Substitute Share Repurchase Price that the Substitute Option Issuer is\nnot prohibited from delivering; and (ii) deliver, as appropriate, either (A) to\nthe Substitute Option Holder, a new Substitute Option evidencing the right of\nthe Substitute Option Holder to purchase that number of shares of the\nSubstitute Common Stock obtained by multiplying the number of shares of the\nSubstitute Common Stock for which the surrendered Substitute Option was\nexercisable at the time of delivery of the notice of repurchase by a fraction,\nthe numerator of which is the Substitute Option Repurchase Price less Out-of-\nPocket Expenses and the portion thereof theretofore delivered to the Substitute\nOption Holder and the denominator of which is the Substitute Option Repurchase\nPrice less Out-of-Pocket Expenses, or (B) to the Substitute Share Owner, a\ncertificate for the Substitute Option Shares it is then so prohibited from\nrepurchasing, assuming that the portion of the Substitute Option Repurchase\nPrice theretofore delivered is first applied to the payment of Out-of-Pocket\nExpenses and any remainder is applied to the repurchase of Substitute Option\nShares.\n9. Extension of Time\n   The period for exercise of certain rights under Section 2 shall be extended:\n(i) to the extent necessary to obtain all regulatory approvals for the exercise\nof such rights, and for the expiration of all statutory waiting\n                                      B-6\n<PAGE>\nperiods; and (ii) to the extent necessary to avoid liability under Section\n16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the ""1934 Act"") by\nreason of such exercise.\n10.

(""Merger Sub""), a wholly owned\nsubsidiary of Microsoft, propose to enter into an Agreement and Plan of\nReorganization, substantially in the form of the draft dated September 11, 1999\n(the ""Merger Agreement"") which provides, among other things, for the merger\n(the ""Merger"") of Merger Sub with and into Visio. Pursuant to the Merger, Visio\nwill become a wholly owned subsidiary of Microsoft and each outstanding share\nof common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the ""Visio Common Stock""), other\nthan shares held in treasury or held by Microsoft or any subsidiary of\nMicrosoft or as to which dissenters\' rights have been perfected, will be\nconverted into the right to receive 0.45 shares (the ""Exchange Ratio"") of\ncommon stock, par value $0.0000125 per share, of Microsoft (the ""Microsoft\nCommon Stock""). The terms and conditions of the Merger are more fully set forth\nin the Merger Agreement.\n   You have asked for our opinion as to whether the Exchange Ratio pursuant to\nthe Merger Agreement is fair from a financial point of view to the holders of\nshares of Visio Common Stock.\n   For purposes of the opinion set forth herein, we have:\n     (i) reviewed certain publicly available financial statements and other\n  business and financial information of Visio and Microsoft, respectively;\n     (ii) reviewed certain internal financial statements and other financial\n  and operating data concerning Visio prepared by the management of Visio;\n     (iii) discussed the past and current operations and financial condition\n  and the prospects of Visio, including information relating to certain\n  strategic, financial and operational benefits anticipated from the Merger,\n  with senior executives of Visio;\n     (iv) discussed the past and current operations and financial condition\n  and the prospects of Microsoft, including information relating to certain\n  strategic, financial and operational benefits anticipated from the Merger,\n  with senior executives of Microsoft;\n     (v) reviewed the pro forma impact of the Merger on the earnings per\n  share of Microsoft;\n     (vi) reviewed the reported prices and trading activity for the Visio\n  Common Stock and Microsoft Common Stock;\n     (vii) compared the financial performance of Visio and Microsoft and the\n  prices and trading activity of the Visio Common Stock and Microsoft Common\n  Stock with that of certain other publicly-traded companies comparable with\n  Visio and Microsoft and their securities;\n     (viii) reviewed the financial terms, to the extent publicly available,\n  of certain comparable acquisition transactions;\n     (ix) reviewed and discussed with the senior managements of Visio and\n  Microsoft their strategic rationales for the Merger;\n     (x) participated in discussions and negotiations among representatives\n  of Visio and Microsoft and their financial and legal advisors;\n                                      C-1\n<PAGE>\n     (xi) reviewed the draft Merger Agreement and certain related agreements;\n  and\n     (xii) performed such other analyses as we have deemed appropriate.\n   We have assumed and relied upon, without independent verification, the\naccuracy and completeness of the information reviewed by us for the purposes of\nthis opinion. With respect to the internal financial statements and other\nfinancial and operating data, and discussions relating to the strategic,\nfinancial and operational benefits anticipated from the Merger provided by\nVisio, we have assumed that they have, in each case, been reasonably prepared\non bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of the\nprospects of Visio and Microsoft. We have relied upon the assessment by the\nmanagements of Visio and Microsoft of their ability to retain key employees of\nVisio. We have also relied upon, without independent verification, the\nassessment by the managements of Visio and Microsoft of: (i) the strategic and\nother benefits expected to result from the Merger; (ii) the timing and risks\nassociated with the integration of Visio and Microsoft; and (iii) the validity\nof, and risks associated with, Visio\'s and Microsoft\'s existing and future\ntechnologies, services or business models. We have not made any independent\nvaluation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities or technology of Visio and\nMicrosoft, nor have we been furnished with any such appraisals. In addition, we\nhave assumed that the Merger will be consummated in accordance with the terms\nset forth in the Merger Agreement, including, among other things, that the\nMerger will be accounted for as a ""pooling-of-interests"" business combination\nin accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles and the Merger\nwill be treated as a tax-free reorganization and/or exchange pursuant to the\nInternal Revenue Code of 1986. Our opinion is necessarily based on financial,\neconomic, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information made\navailable to us as of, the date hereof.\n   In arriving at our opinion, we were not authorized to solicit, and did not\nsolicit, interest from any party with respect to the acquisition of, business\ncombination with or any other extraordinary transaction involving Visio.\n   We have acted as financial advisor to the Board of Directors of the Company\nin connection with this transaction and will receive a fee for our services. In\nthe past, Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated (""Morgan Stanley"") and its\naffiliates have provided financial advisory services for Microsoft and have\nreceived fees for the rendering of these services. In the ordinary course of\nour business we may actively trade the securities of Visio and Microsoft for\nour own account and for the accounts of our customers and, accordingly, may at\nany time hold a long or short position in such securities.\n   It is understood that this letter is for the information of the Board of\nDirectors of Visio, except that this opinion may be included in its entirety in\nany filing made by Visio with the Securities and Exchange Commission in respect\nof the transaction. In addition, this opinion does not in any manner address\nthe prices at which the Microsoft Common Stock will trade following the\nconsummation of the Merger, and Morgan Stanley expresses no opinion or\nrecommendation as to how the shareholders of Visio should vote at the\nshareholders\' meeting to be held in connection with the Merger.\n   Based upon and subject to the foregoing, we are of the opinion on the date\nhereof that the Exchange Ratio pursuant to the Merger Agreement is fair from a\nfinancial point of view to the shareholders of Visio.\n                                          Very truly yours,\n                                          MORGAN STANLEY & CO.

Purpose of the Transaction.  \n                                        \nOn September 11, 2008, Crisp commenced the Offer upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth\nin the Offer to Purchase and in the related Letter of Transmittal. The Offer expired at 12:00 midnight,\nNew York City time, at the end of Wednesday, October 8, 2008.

Crisp\nultimately acquired 25,124,846 Shares pursuant to the Offer. The purpose of the Offer was for Microsoft,\nthrough Crisp, to acquire control of, and the entire equity interest in, Greenfield. The Offer, as the\nfirst step in the acquisition of Greenfield, was intended to facilitate the acquisition of all\noutstanding Shares.\n\nPursuant to the Merger Agreement, each Greenfield director, other than Joel R. Mesznik and Joseph A.\nRipp, submitted letters of resignation from the Greenfield board of directors effective immediately upon\nthe time of acceptance for payment and payment for Shares pursuant to the Offer (the \x93Acceptance Time\x94),\nwhich occurred on October 9, 2008. Effective immediately upon the Acceptance Time, the Greenfield board\nof directors appointed Keith R. Dolliver, Benjamin O. Orndorff and John A. Seethoff as Greenfield\ndirectors. Such individuals were designated for appointment as directors by Microsoft pursuant to the\nMerger Agreement, and their appointment provided Microsoft with majority representation on the Greenfield\nboard of directors.\n\n5\n\nOn October 15, 2008, the Merger was effected through a short-form merger of Crisp with and into\nGreenfield under Delaware law without the vote of, or any other action by, other Greenfield stockholders.\nThe purpose of the Merger was to acquire all outstanding Shares not validly tendered and purchased\npursuant to the Offer. Upon the Merger, each share of Crisp held by Microsoft converted into one share of\nCommon Stock. Thereafter, Crisp\x92s separate corporate existence ceased and Greenfield survived the Merger\nas a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of Microsoft. Immediately prior to the Effective Time, Messrs.\nMesznik, Seethoff and Ripp resigned from the Greenfield board of directors.\n\nAs a result of the Merger, each Share outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time was cancelled\nand ceased to exist and (other than Shares held by Greenfield or its subsidiaries or by stockholders who\nexercise appraisal rights under, and in accordance with, Delaware law) converted in the Merger into the\nright to receive $17.50 per Share, without interest thereon and less any applicable withholding taxes.\nFurther, upon the consummation of the Merger:\n                                                                                                         \n      the directors of Crisp immediately prior to the Effective Time became the directors of             \n      Greenfield;                                                                                        \n                                                                                                         \n                                                                                                         \n      the officers of Greenfield immediately prior to the Effective Time became the officers of          \n      Greenfield, as the surviving corporation;                                                          \n                                                                                                         \n                                                                                                         \n      the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of Greenfield were amended and restated pursuant to    \n      the provisions of the Merger Agreement so as to read in their                                      \n      entirety as the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of Crisp as in effect immediately prior    \n      to the Effective Time (except the references to Crisp\x92s name was replaced by references to          \n      Greenfield and certain other minor changes were made);                                             \n      and                                                                                                \n                                                                                                         \n                                                                                                         \n      the certificate of ownership and merger was filed with the Secretary of State of the State of      \n      Delaware.                                                                                          \n                                                                                                         \nFollowing the Effective Time:\n                                                                                                         \n      a Form 25 was filed with the SEC to delist the Shares from the NASDAQ Global Market and to seek    \n      termination of the Shares from registration under Section\xa012(b)                                    \n      of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \x93Exchange Act\x94); and                         \n                                                                                                         \n                                                                                                         \n      a Form 15 was filed with the SEC to seek termination of the Shares from registration under         \n      Section\xa012(g) of the Exchange Act.                                                                 \n                                                                                                         \nIn connection with its entry into the Merger Agreement, Microsoft entered into an agreement with ZM\nSurveys LLC, for the sale of the assets comprising the internet survey solutions business (the \x93ISS\nBusiness\x94) operated by Greenfield and certain of its subsidiaries.\n\nMicrosoft will evaluate the non-ISS Business-related business and operations of Greenfield after the\nconsummation of the Merger, and will take such actions as it deems appropriate under the circumstances\nthen existing.

Security and Issuer\nThis statement relates to shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, and\nshares of Series A preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Audible, Inc.,\na Delaware corporation (""Company""), with its principal office located at 65\nWillowbrook Blvd., Wayne, NJ 07470.\nItem 2.   Identity and Background\nThis statement is filed on behalf of Microsoft Corporation, a Washington\ncorporation (""Microsoft""), with its principal offices located at One Microsoft\nWay, Redmond, Washington 98052-6399. Microsoft develops, manufactures, licenses,\nand supports a wide range of software products for a multitude of computing\ndevices. Microsoft\'s online efforts include MSN (TM) network of Internet\nproducts and services and alliances with companies involved with broadband\naccess and various forms of digital interactivity. Microsoft also licenses\nconsumer software programs; sells hardware devices; provides consulting\nservices; trains and certifies system integrators; and researches and develops\nadvanced technologies for future software products. During the past five years,\nMicrosoft has neither been convicted in a criminal proceeding (excluding traffic\nviolations and similar misdemeanors), nor has it been subject to a judgment,\ndecree, or final order in a civil proceeding enjoining future violations of, or\nprohibiting or mandating activities subject to, federal or state securities laws\nor finding any violation with respect to such laws.\nItem 3.   Source and Amount of Funds or Other Consideration\nIn December 1998, prior to Audible\'s initial public offering, Microsoft acquired\n1,250,000 shares of Audible Series D preferred stock at a price of $4.00 per\nshare for an aggregate purchase price of $5,000,000, which amount was funded by\nMicrosoft\'s working capital. In April 1999, Audible issued to Microsoft a\nwarrant to purchase 100,000 shares of common stock at a price per share equal to\nthe price to the public of Audible common stock in Audible\'s initial public\noffering ($9.00 per share). This warrant may be exercised until November 18,\n2003. Upon Audible\'s initial public offering on July 15, 1999, all of Audible\'s\npreferred stock converted into common stock and the 1,250,000 shares of Audible\nSeries D preferred stock held by Microsoft became 1,875,000 shares of Audible\ncommon stock, par value $0.01 per share, on a basis of three shares of Audible\ncommon stock for every two shares of Audible Series D preferred stock.\nOn February 8, 2001, Microsoft entered into an agreement with Audible to acquire\n2,666,666 shares of Audible Series A convertible preferred stock, par value\n$0.01 per share, at a price of $3.75 per share for an aggregate purchase price\nof $9,999,997.50, which amount was funded by Microsoft\'s working capital. The\nprice per share was based on the closing price of Audible common stock on\nFebruary 7, 2001 (a fifty percent (50%) premium was added to this closing price,\nwhich was then multiplied by four (4) for the purchase price per share of the\nSeries A convertible preferred stock). The sale of shares to Microsoft under\nthis agreement closed February 23, 2001.\nItem 4.   Purpose of Transaction\nMicrosoft\'s acquisitions of Audible shares have been made for investment\npurposes. Depending on future evaluations of the business prospects of Audible\nand other factors, including, but not limited to, general economic and business\nconditions, Microsoft may retain or, from time to time, increase its holdings or\ndispose of all or a portion of its holdings, subject to any applicable legal and\ncontracted restrictions on its ability to do so. Microsoft has no present plan\nor intention that would result in or relate to any of the transactions in\nsubparagraphs (a) through (j) of Item 4 of Schedule 13D.\n<PAGE>\nItem 5.

Such right will be a right to\n     subscribe for Ordinary Shares or the relevant convertible securities to the\n     extent such subscription does not result in a Debenture Change of Control\n     (as defined in Telewest\'s Articles of Association), and the balance being a\n     right to subscribe for Limited Voting Shares or convertible securities that\n     convert into Limited Voting Shares, as applicable.

Security and Issuer\n         -------------------\n     This Statement on Schedule 13D (this ""Statement"") relates to shares of\nTicketmaster Online CitySearch (""TMCS"") Class B common stock, par value $0.01\nper share (the ""Class B Common Stock"").\nItem 2.  Identity and Background\n         -----------------------\n     This Statement is being filed by Microsoft Corporation, a Washington\ncorporation (""Microsoft"").  The principal business address of Microsoft is One\nMicrosoft Way, Redmond, Washington 98052.  Microsoft develops, manufactures,\nlicenses and supports a range of software products, including scalable operating\nsystems, server applications, business/consumer productivity applications,\nsoftware development tools and Internet software and technologies.\n     (a)-(c); (f) The name, business address, present principal occupation or\nemployment, and the name and principal business of any corporation or other\norganization in which such employment is conducted of each of the directors and\nexecutive officers of Microsoft is set forth in Schedule I hereto, which is\nincorporated herein by reference.  With the exception of (i) Bernard P. Vergnes\nand Michel Lacombe, who are a citizens of France, (ii) Joachim Kempin, who is a\ncitizen of Germany, and (iii) Orlando Ayala Lozano, who is a citizen of\nColumbia, each person listed in Schedule I hereto is a citizen of the United\nStates.\n     (d)-(e) During the last five years, neither Microsoft nor, to the knowledge\nof Microsoft, any of the persons listed on Schedule I hereto (i) has been\nconvicted in a criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations or similar\nmisdemeanors) or (ii) has been a party to a civil proceeding of a judicial or\nadministrative body of competent jurisdiction and as a result of such proceeding\nwas or is subject to a judgment, decree or final order enjoining future\nviolations of, or prohibiting or mandating activities subject to, federal or\nstate securities laws or finding any violation with respect to such laws.\nItem 3.  Source and Amount of Funds or Other Consideration\n         -------------------------------------------------\n     Pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of July 19, 1999, a\ncopy of which is incorporated by reference as Exhibit 1, Microsoft received, at\nclosing and by virtue of the merger, 7,000,000 shares of TMCS Class B Common\nStock, par value $.01 per share.\n     At the closing on September 17, 1999 of the transactions described above,\nTMCS issued two warrants to Microsoft as consideration for the services provided\nby Microsoft pursuant to a Distribution and Cross Promotion Agreement between\nMicrosoft and TMCS.  Warrant No. 1 entitles Microsoft to purchase up to\n1,500,000 shares of TMCS Class B Common Stock at an exercise price of $60 per\nshare.  The purchase rights are exercisable at any time during the 5-year period\nfollowing closing.  The amount of shares purchasable pursuant to Warrant No. 1\nwill be adjusted to reflect any stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization,\nor other event that would dilute Microsoft\'s interest in the absence of\nadjustment.  The terms of Warrant No. 1 permit cashless exercise after the 18-\nmonth anniversary of closing.  Microsoft is restricted from selling or otherwise\ndisposing of shares issuable pursuant to Warrant No. 1 for 180 days following\nclosing, but may engage in hedging transactions with respect to the warrant\nshares.\n     Warrant No. 2 entitles Microsoft to purchase up to 3,000,000 shares of TMCS\nClass B Common Stock.  The warrant is exercisable at any time between closing\nand the 5-year anniversary thereof, at an initial strike price of $30 per share.\nThe exercise price decreases, however, by $1/16 for each increment of $1/16 by\nwhich the fair market value of TMCS Class B Common Stock exceeds $30.  The\nexercise\n                                       3\n<PAGE>\nprice cannot be reduced below $1/16. To illustrate, if, on the date of exercise,\nTMCS Class B Common Stock is trading at $40, the strike price will be $20. If\nTMCS Class B Common Stock is trading at $59 15/16 or higher, the strike price\nwill be $1/16. The amount of shares purchasable pursuant to Warrant No. 2 will\nbe adjusted in accordance with any stock split, stock dividend,\nrecapitalization, or other event having a diluting effect on Microsoft\'s\ninterest. The terms of Warrant No. 2 permit cashless exercise after the 18-month\nanniversary of closing. Microsoft is restricted from selling or otherwise\ndisposing of shares issuable pursuant to Warrant No. 2 for 180 days following\nclosing, but may engage in hedging transactions with respect to the warrant\nshares.\nItem 4. Purpose of the Transaction\n        --------------------------\n     (a)-(j) On July 19, 1999, Microsoft Corporation, a Washington corporation\n(""Microsoft""), Ticketmaster Online-CitySearch, Inc, a Delaware corporation\n(""TMCS""), Sidewalk.com, Inc., a Nevada corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary\nof Microsoft (""Sidewalk""), and Ticketmaster Acquisition, Inc., a Nevada\ncorporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of TMCS (""Sub"") entered into an\nAgreement and Plan of Merger (""Merger Agreement""), a copy of which is\nincorporated by reference as Exhibit 1.\n     Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Sub was merged with and into Sidewalk and\nthe separate corporate existence of Sub ceased on September 17, 1999. As a\nresult of the Merger, TMCS owns 100% of the Sidewalk outstanding stock.  All\noutstanding shares of Sidewalk common stock prior to the Merger were by virtue\nof the Merger converted into and became 7,000,000 shares of TMCS Class B Common\nStock (the ""Merger Consideration"").\n     Microsoft and TMCS also entered into a Distribution and Cross Promotion\nAgreement in consideration of which TMCS issued two warrants entitling Microsoft\nto acquire 4,500,000 additional shares of TMCS common stock.\n     The foregoing summaries of the Merger Agreement, Warrant No. 1, and Warrant\nNo. 2 do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by\nreference to the text of such agreements included as Exhibits 1, 2, 3,\nrespectively.\n     Except as set forth in this statement, the Merger Agreement, Warrant No. 1,\nand Warrant No. 2, neither Microsoft nor, to the best of Microsoft\'s knowledge,\nany of the individuals named in Schedule I hereto has any plans or proposals\nwhich relate to or which would result in or relate to any of the actions\nspecified in subparagraphs (a) through (j) of Item 4 of Schedule 13D.\nItem 5.  Interest in Securities of the Issuer\n         ------------------------------------\n     (a)-(b) By reason of the Merger Agreement, Microsoft may be deemed to have\nbeneficial ownership of, and sole dispositive power with respect to, the\n7,000,000 shares of TMCS Class B Common Stock granted to Microsoft in the Merger\nAgreement, and the two warrants for 4,500,000 additional shares of TMCS Class B\nCommon Stock granted to Microsoft pursuant to the Distribution Agreement.  Based\non the number of shares of TMCS Class B Common Stock outstanding, Microsoft may\nbe deemed to beneficially own approximately 28.4% of the Class B Common Stock\noutstanding, including the potential exercise of the two warrants totalling\n4,500,000 shares of Class B Common Stock.  Both warrants provide for the\nexercise of purchase rights at any time during a five-year period following the\nclosing of the Merger.\n     Microsoft currently has the right to vote 7,000,000 shares of TMCS Class B\nCommon Stock, representing 19.5% of the class, and upon the exercise of the two\nwarrants for an additional 4,500,000\n                                       4\n<PAGE>\nclass B shares, Microsoft would have the right to vote 11,500,000 shares,\nrepresenting 28.4% of the TMCS Class B Shares. Shares of TMCS Class B Common\nStock are voted as a group with shares of TMCS Class A Common Stock. Each share\nof Class A Common Stock is entitled to ten votes per share, while each share of\nClass B Common Stock is entitled to one vote per share. TMCS\' most recent Form\n10-K, dated as of December 31, 1999, stated that there were 49,664,907 Class A\nCommon Shares outstanding, and 35,932,320 Class B Common Shares outstanding.\nMicrosoft owns no Class A shares, and would have approximately 2.14% of the\ncombined vote of TMCS Class A and B Common Stock, if both warrants were\nexercised.\n     The amount listed on item 11 of Schedule 13D as beneficially owned is the\nsum of (i) the 7,000,000 shares obtained upon close of the Merger and (ii) the\n4,500,000 shares which may be obtained at any time upon exercise of the purchase\nrights.\n     (c) Except as described herein, neither Microsoft nor, to the best of\nMicrosoft\'s knowledge, any of the individuals named in schedule I hereto, has\neffected any transaction in TMCS stock during the past 60 days.\n     (d) Ownership of Class B Common Stock by Officers and Directors.  To the\nbest of Microsoft\'s knowledge, none of Microsoft\'s executive officers or\ndirectors is known to have the right to receive or the power to direct the\nreceipt of dividends from, or the proceeds from the sale of any shares of TMCS\nother than the following:\n     (e) Not applicable.\nItem 6.  Contracts, Arrangements, Understandings or Relationships with Respect\n         ---------------------------------------------------------------------\n         to Securities of the Issuer\n         ---------------------------\n     Neither Microsoft or, to the best of Microsoft\'s knowledge, any of the\nindividuals named in Schedule I hereto has any contracts, arrangements,\nunderstandings or relationships (legal or otherwise) with any person with\nrespect to any securities of TMCS, including, but not limited to, transfer or\nvoting of any of the securities, finder\'s fees, joint ventures, loan or option\narrangements, puts or calls, guarantees of profits, division of profits or loss,\nor the giving or withholding of proxies.\nItem 7.
